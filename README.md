# Software-Engineering-Project
TO RUN THE PROJECT:
Run main.py in the NN_filter folder
this file calls model.py and utils.py and uses the data set in the data folder

Running this requires pandas, keras, sklearn and matplotlib
Note: data_analysis.py was used to make a graph and is not related to the filter.

ham,the scotsman thu NUMBER aug NUMBER meaningful sentences tracey lawson if you ever wanted to look like one of the most dangerous inmates in prison history as one judge described charles bronson now s your chance bronson the serial hostage taker not the movie star has written a health and fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary muscle power solitary fitness a title which bears testament to the fact that bronson NUMBER has spent NUMBER of his NUMBER prison years in solitary confinement explains how he has turned himself into a lean mean fitness machine while living NUMBER hours a day in a space just NUMBER feet by eight feet on a diet of scrubs grub and at virtually no cost the book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a fortune on gym memberships protein supplements or designer trainers and starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the exercise industry i pick up a fitness mag i start to laugh and i wipe my arse with it is the opening paragraph penned by bronson it s a joke and a big con and they call me a criminal you can t help feeling he has a point this is not the first book that bronson has written from behind bars having already published birdman opens his mind which features drawings and poems created by bronson while in prison and he is not the first prisoner to discover creative expression while residing at her majesty s pleasure jimmy boyle the scots sculptor and novelist discovered his artistic talents when he was sent to barlinnie prison s famous special unit which aimed to help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to express their emotions artistically boyle was sentenced to life for the murder of babs rooney in NUMBER once released he moved to edinburgh where he has become a respected artist his first novel hero of the underworld was published in NUMBER and his autobiography a sense of freedom was made into an award winning film hugh collins was jailed for life in NUMBER for the murder of william mooney in glasgow and in his first year in barlinnie prison stabbed three prison officers earning him an extra seven year sentence but after being transferred to the same unit that boyle attended he learned to sculpt and developed an interest in art he later published autobiography of a murderer a frank account of glasgow s criminal culture in the NUMBERs which received critical praise and lord archer doesn t seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books that have made him millions while in jail he recently signed a three book deal with macmillan publishers worth a reported NUMBER million and is no doubt scribbling away as we speak so why is it that men like collins bronson and boyle who can be so destructive towards society on the outside can become so creative once stuck on the inside steve richards bronson s publisher has published many books about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both pragmatic and profound he says prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have known a stable environment and this can be the first time they have the chance to focus on their creative skills it may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an education if their early years have been hard it could be the first time anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents however richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that he says once they are behind bars the cold light of day hits them and they examine the very essence of who they are they ask themselves am i a man who wants to be remembered for violence or am i a man who can contribute to society who can be remembered for something good bronson who was born michael gordon peterson but changed his name to that of the hollywood star of the death wish films has so far been remembered mainly for things bad he was originally jailed for seven years for armed robbery in NUMBER and has had a series of sentences added to his original term over the years as a result of attacking people in prison in NUMBER he was jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly two days during a jail siege standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing NUMBERlbs he is renowned for his strength he has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands and does up to NUMBER NUMBER yes NUMBER NUMBER press ups a day as he puts it i can hit a man NUMBER times in four seconds i can push NUMBER press ups in NUMBER seconds but judging by our current obsession with health and exercise solitary fitness might be the book which will see bronson s face sitting on every coffee table in the land he might be the man to give us the dream body which so many so called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into because bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists all this crap about high protein drinks pills diets it s just a load of bollocks and a multi million pound racket he writes in what can only be described as a refreshingly honest style we can all be fat lazy bastards it s our choice i m sick of hearing and reading about excuses if you stuff your face with shit you become shit that s logical to me as motivational mantras go that might be just the kick up the er

ham,spamassassin is hurting democracy owen URL internet can level the political playing field by mike mccurry and larry purpuro not many months from now people across the country will experience one of the great recurring features of american democracy at shopping malls on factory floors at church socials and even on our front stoops we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in public office while chances are high that we won t know them personally they will walk up to us offer a handshake and a flier and ask for our votes just as technology is affecting every other area of communication it has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters in this year s gop gubernatorial primary california secretary of state bill jones who faced better funded candidates acquired the e mail addresses of more than a million potential california voters and sent each an unsolicited e mail asking for support that day he might have chosen any of the more traditional and more expensive methods of contacting voters such as direct mail radio spots or tv ads but he spent only about NUMBER cents per message instead of NUMBER cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium had jones chosen direct mail radio or tv that communication would have been equally unsolicited as defined in the e mail world few voters would have opted in to receive campaign information from jones through any of those channels the response to jones e mail effort however was swift and intense he was lambasted by anti spam advocates and media coverage was almost entirely negative to be fair some of jones tactics could have been refined he used a less than perfect list and no standard practice paid for disclaimer in the message his detractors however attacked him not for his tactical miscues but because the e mail was sent unsolicited in fact jones online campaign may have been his most visible asset in an era of cynicism toward money in politics money typically spent on other unsolicited communication mediums jones tried to level the playing field no one likes commercial spam it is irrelevant and untargeted and can be highly intrusive and even offensive but as a sophisticated society it s time to differentiate commercial spam from very different unsolicited e mail sent by political candidates to voters the debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in congress that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam we believe e mail is no more intrusive than direct mail telemarketing or tv advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters a simple link in good e mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of future mailings direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be taken off a list and viewers must repeatedly endure tv ads when a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest he or she can use the internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes with more than NUMBER percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e mail accounts it makes sense that political candidates use this medium candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better ensure quality of e mail lists and target content to specific recipient groups but the broader point remains when a political candidate sends a voter an e mail that recipient can choose to delete the message without opening it unsubscribe from the list read it or even reply and engage the sender that choice should belong to the voter not to anti spam advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e mail political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best they can and let voters decide what to do with that information mike mccurry former press secretary for president clinton is ceo of an advocacy management and communications software company larry purpuro the former republican national committee deputy chief of staff is founder and president of a political e marketing firm this was written for the los angeles times URL

ham, you have multiple generations of peasants squatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a human parts of the property package when i d read that getting legal title can take NUMBER years when i believe that NUMBER year ought to be more than sufficient and helped by the cairo reference i d assumed that we were talking about the urban poor if i see people living in mansions or even in suburban subdivisions i assume they didn t have too much trouble with their titles if i see people living in shanties and haphazard alleyways i tend to assume their parcels weren t exactly recorded on the government maps or paid for with a bank loan especially when nearby vacant lots have shotgun wielding men presumably intent on keeping them development free now it may be that manhattanites view of america to say that outside of metro manila davao and maybe another city or two cebu everything else literally is the boondocks but going on that very broad assumption i guess i m describing the flip side of mr roger s experience the paisanos who leave behind those who remain on a patron s rural land move to manila and the second assumption squat in shantytowns there at least until they can line up a middle class job so going on two large assumptions i can come up with a scenario under which title would take NUMBER years a shantytown arises somewhere in the midst of a section or whatever the spanish used to divvy up the land and it takes decades of arguing to put together a package which somehow can both compensate the owner and record lots for the inhabitants just transferring title to an existing lot between parties who have money ought not to be a problem the obvious solution at least to us barking farting chihuahuas on fork is to introduce market mechanisms it is left as an exercise to come up with one which works when many of the agents are perceived to have negligible npv dave land reform meant that all the agricultural producers had to plant crops all the time profitable or not what happened to more highly capitalized land putting in trees instead of crops sounds like it might sidestep that mr long i think you d particularly enjoy the de soto work on the to find list any chance of an explanation of that bell jar in the meantime URL

ham, URL hamza s horrid but we must tolerate him rod liddle wednesday august NUMBER NUMBER the guardian sheikh abu hamza al masri our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman to scare the kiddies spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing with his own children in victoria park hackney i ve often wondered what incendiary islamic fundamentalist clerics do on statutory public holidays head for the beach and maybe swing by b q on the way home i had hoped i had this beguiling vision of hamza paddling in the sea an ice cream cone in his one good hand the waves tickling his shins and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen for once instead of planning the extermination of zionism and america and maybe me and you too but b q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond hamza s budget since the bank of england froze his assets so victoria park had to do but he sounded happy enough when i spoke to him with the babble of tiny cheerful islamic proto warriors in the background you must know hamza he s the imam designed it would seem by the daily mail s cartoonist mac large metal hook in place of a left hand one eye covered by a patch the other a baleful watchful milky white we don t mock the disabled any more these days unless it s someone like hamza whom we don t like then if you ll excuse the inapt phraseology the gloves come off so hamza is known with that vaulting imagination typical of the british right as captain hook in articles which usually call for his arrest or extradition to the us or deportation back home to egypt or maybe off to pakistan or afghanistan where he fought the russians for years and thus sustained his disabilities anywhere really just out of here and if we can t lock him up or chuck him out of the country maybe we can force him to shut up because we don t like hamza very much we weren t that fond of him before september NUMBER but afterwards in that nervy paranoid few months when we all thought the sky might fall in our disapprobation turned into political persecution and now the daily mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they ve got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory manner urging warfare on and looting of enemies of islam all out of context and a very long time ago says the imam not unduly bothered but perhaps he should be because our reputation for broad mindedness and tolerance towards people like hamza was thinning even before the mirror s scoop hamza preaches or preached at the scary finsbury park mosque so earlier this year the charity commissioners banned him from doing so because of his allegedly inflammatory remarks i didn t know charity commissioners were meant to do stuff like that he has had his passport seized and not returned his assets have been frozen he is tailed by the police every now and then and his access to the media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations and the press and this last point is because we tell ourselves endlessly repeating the mantra over and over again and fervently wishing it to be true hamza is not representative of british muslims as if british muslims were a simple homogenous thing with a single voice that one could turn to every now and then for explanation and perhaps succour the trouble is in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was revealed to be rather more representative than the list of those government approved muslim spokesmen who were uncomfortably i suspect dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism and a blanket condemnation of the taliban an opinion poll commissioned by radio NUMBER s today programme revealed that an overwhelming majority of british muslims were against george bush s crusade one in six were to put it mildly ambivalent about the attack on the us the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally a large majority thought the war against terrorism was a war against islam which is what hamza said repeatedly but it was something that at the time we didn t want to hear now if you quiz the man on present policy at home and abroad he comes across superficially at least as someone from the liberal left no war against iraq britain to become independent of us foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with arab states stronger action against israel mistrust of global capitalism redistribution of wealth nor is he particularly anti semitic so far as i can tell although i don t suppose he will be holidaying in eilat this year in yesterday s guardian the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to hamza and was grateful for the sheikh s message of condolence when a london synagogue was attacked which is not to say that hamza is a peaceable jeffersonian democrat who has been wilfully misrepresented he is without question rather more inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public his ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of islam he would be happy in a truly islamic society to stone women to death for adultery for example you and i would find many perhaps most of his views utterly repellent and that s the point because hamza is the true test of our apparent desire to be multicultural multiculturalism is not surely the cheerful appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the ruling hegemony that is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism multiculturalism is rather the ability of society to tolerate views that are antithetical to the dominant culture and maybe learn from them the fbi has been investigating hamza but of course has found nothing remotely incriminating the real reason for his vilification and persecution is simply the pungency of his views it is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his rhetoric increases hostility against the muslim population generally this is a perfectly noble argument but it does not wash you don t defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn t exist and if british muslims maybe a minority maybe not feel a growing sense of unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy it is not because they have been led in that direction by hamza shutting the man up therefore won t make a difference it is rather as louis macneice had it the glass is falling hour by hour the glass will fall for ever but if you break the bloody glass you won t hold up the weather yahoo groups sponsor NUMBER dvds free s p join now URL to unsubscribe from this group send an email to

ham, m mike masnick mike techdirt com writes m in which world are we talking about that may be true for the m first sale but once something is out in the world the m creator loses control if i buy a chair you built and then m decide to give it away to my neighbor by you re definition he m just stole from you i don t endorse the whole riaa thing but to be accurate you would have to duplicate the chair so that both you and your neighbour could continue to sit down and yes i suppose that would be more serious they can sit on your copy but if you start churning out exact dups of a name brand artifact people with law degrees start to smell money for example i could copy a gibson guitar exactly so long as a i don t put orville s name on the headstock and b i license the patented bracing methods if i instead try to sell a homebuilt guitar on ebay with gibson written in crayon on the headstock and then claim it is a true les paul limited edition i expect people would get upset m why is it that people don t understand that giving stuff away m is a perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses to play the devil s advocate here it s not about giving stuff away it is about granting endless and cascading duplication distribution rights even if _i_ only make the copy i give to you that doesn t stop you from making NUMBER copies to sell m access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff this is the difficult question how will they draw the distinction the other stuff is just as easy to duplicate as the free stuff this is why ms is hunting people with illegal windows it s no harder to dup than a linux cd only what is there that actually prevents people from doing it personally i don t think the issue should have anything to do with sales or units the issue is that basic phallacy that says a suit should be able to own someone else s intellectual property sarah mclaughlin isn t suing you it s her label s legal dept because it s the label who stands to lose sarah s already fat beyond her wildest dreams so a few bucks here or there or even if the well dried up tomorrow it s not going to really traumatize her unless she s been blazingly stupid with her money but the label like disney and mickey they need the cash cow so they can keep all sorts of uncreative hangers on in limos and coke if you thought only elvis or brian jones or dennis wilson had problems with beautiful people deadbeat leech friends draining their riches think again the problem is really very simple because it is semantic and until we make the semantic flip it s unsolvable but like trisecting an angle all it takes is looking at the same situation in a different way here s the revelation elvis never ever made a hit record elvis didn t make the hits his fans made the hits his fans did the work cleaning toilets manning the convenience stores driving milk trucks sitting at endless office desks they did the real labour that paid for every last one of elvis presley s pills all elvis did was sing into a microphone every so often and pen or collect the odd song that all those people liked and wanted as something of their own but it s not _elvis_ who made them universal statements it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs into their own lives it was pull technology not push therefore the question becomes how many times must these fans pay before they own what they themselves have created they pay royalties for listening to the radio for blank tapes for concert tickets for a beer in a bar with a cover band they pay over and over and over again for the right to make some hack writer s song their favourite song that s where the whole system has been seriously warped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into your thinking that it is the elvis who makes the elvis it s not it s the people who make them the songs are already theirs gary lawrence murphy garym teledyn com teledynamics communications inc business advantage through community software URL computers are useless they can only give you answers pablo picasso 
ham, ultimately there was a big disagreement about how to sell the product sales guys wanted to sell the thing for a gazillion dollars to megaclients but we thought it would make more sense to get more people using it so we could get more feedback from many different places the bottom line was that the route we wound up going megaclients for megabucks had a megalong sales cycle the sales force staffed up and tried to sell the earliest releases of the software even succeeding in a few significant cases but couldn t get enough to cover their own expenses much less the actual development of the product now where have i seen that before oh yeah its happening to me right now

kitchen and other household equipment it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed it is currently trying to contact medina and her family medina s husband raul jurado told reuters his wife remained skeptical she got no help in NUMBER that i know about he said she thinks governments never deliver maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true jurado said his wife whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists had turned down reuters request for an interview medical rarity no one has ever established who was the father of medina s child or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped one of nine children born to country folk in ticrapo an andean

her first period at NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER became pregnant aged NUMBER years and eight months and that when doctors performed the caesarean to deliver her baby they found she already had fully mature sexual organs her swelling stomach worried her parents they thought it was a tumor he said but shamans ruled out village superstitions including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town pisco there came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest he was later released for lack of evidence and doctors police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case sandoval who based his book on media and other published information and some interviews with relatives as medina herself declined to comment said news of the child mother to be drew instant offers of aid including one worth

but within days the state trumped all previous offers decreeing that medina and her baby were in moral danger and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them but sandoval said it abandoned the case after six months it did absolutely nothing for them happy ending though physically mature medina who sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms still behaved like a child preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby who was fed by a wet nurse medina stayed in hospital for NUMBER months finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a supreme court ruling allowing her to live with them again after taunting from schoolmates gerardo who was named after one of the doctors who attended medina and became their mentor discovered when he was NUMBER that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother he died in NUMBER from a disease that attacks the body s bone marrow but sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young medina married and in NUMBER had a second son NUMBER years after her first her second child now lives in mexico she appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject we just want to get on with our lives that s it said jurado adding he thought absolutely nothing of the fact his wife was the world s youngest mother he said the couple s main concern now if the government s offer of aid was genuine was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to medina and which the then government expropriated more than two decades ago that house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site he said its value was more or less NUMBER NUMBER and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own they live now in a modest house accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves paradise if the government really wants to help they should give us the value of our property he said as for sandoval he said he was optimistic that medina s story which he has studied since his student days would turn out well i believe there will be a happy ending he said as a result of the war corporations have now been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic is

ham,hi all i have a question which is a bit tricky and was wondering of anyone has come across this problem before or could point me in the right direction i am involved in porting a sco unix application to linux and we have encountered a problem with the way semaphores are being handled the application uses mulitple processes to run application code with the main process known as the bsh which controls all i o be it screen or file i o syncronisation is handled via semaphores in certain circumstances the main process and the application child process seem to lock up both waiting for the syncronisation semaphores to change state i have attached ddd to the processes and it seems that the semaphore code is doing the correct things for syncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the semop system call i have also noticed that if i introduce a slight delay between changing semaphore states the problem goes away but this causes our entire application to run really sloooww lol is there anything weird or different with the standard implemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could cause a semop to fail to pick up the change in state in a semaphore immediately setting sem_flg ipc_nowait and checking for errno eagain and recalling semop if the semop call fails NUMBER also fixes the problem but again system performance goes down the toilet both the parent controlling process run as the same uid and the parent creates the semaphores with permissions NUMBER any pointers would be appreciated rgds colin nevin __________________________________________________ do you yahoo everything you ll ever need on one web page from news and sport to email and music charts URL irish linux users group ilug URL URL for un subscription information list maintainer listmaster URL

ham, URL the disappearing alliance by dale franks NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER for over two generations the countries of western europe have been our closest allies we stood beside each other through the darkest days of the cold war as partners in the north atlantic treaty organization we celebrated with them over the fall of the soviet empire and the liberation of eastern europe from the yoke of communism tragically a generation from now we may be bitter adversaries europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that hudson institute scholar john fonte has termed progressive transnationalism the key doctrines of this form of post communist progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas among these are the deconstruction of nationalism the promotion of post nationalist ideas of citizenship i e a global citizenry a redefinition of democracy and the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the united nations the european union itself a multinational organization built through the pooling of sovereignty by european nations is post democratic while there is a european parliament the eu s power resides mainly in the unelected european commission ec and its unelected president who face few limits to their power instead of a limited consensual form of government where elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws the eu has an appointed oligarchic executive along with a large attendant bureaucracy whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense moreover the eu has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired by the eu s political elite both the ec and the european court of justice regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected eu member governments this is a step backward in europe s political development european criticism of america is on the rise and the european list of complaints about america is a long and growing one they dislike the fact that our republican system of government is not based on proportional representation they hate the fact that our citizens own guns they despise the fact that we execute murderers they resent the fact that our economy is so large and that americans consume so much they also resent and fear the fact that we have the ability to project american power anywhere in the world on august NUMBER NUMBER adrian hamilton wrote a column in the uk s independent newspaper in which he identified the us as a rogue state who should be restrained perhaps by a european military invasion followed by a decade or so of occupation fortunately the article is satirical not because it exaggerates the way european progressives view the us but rather because the impotence of european military power makes the idea of an invasion of the us literally fantastic at least for now despite the tongue in cheek nature of this editorial however the fact remains that america is increasingly viewed this way by the european intellectual and political elite the europeans actively desire a world where the united nations keeps in check the activities of sovereign states because they have built such a system in europe they feel it s valid for the rest of the world america however is the biggest obstacle to such a system the europeans cannot understand why america places a higher value on the ethos of national sovereignty and limited consensual and constitutional government than it does on compliance with international norms they view all departures from such norms as aberrant because the un member states all have an equal vote in prescribing international norms they assume that since the process is ostensibly legitimate the results must be as well the trouble with this idea of course is that it gives the views of non democratic authoritarian states the same weight as those of free democratic societies it sanctifies the process with no regard to the actual results thus they are unable to make any moral distinction between the us refusals to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the liberty of our citizens and similar refusals from iraq because its dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power our repeated references to the us constitution and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to comply with international norms are incomprehensible to them they assume therefore that our refusal is based on arrogance rather than on a commitment to constitutional rights none of this bodes well for the future of euro american friendship or cooperation if the europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in favor of the new progressivism their criticism of the us will rise while their tolerance of our differences will fall obviously in such a political atmosphere the opportunities for conflict will inevitably increase that thought is frightening enough even more

ham, i have translated the article in full see end of post i think that i ve done a far better job than the google translation at least it s readable now any corrections appreciated stuff in s is my and others additions to the debate my apologies if i ve paraphrased anybody incorrectly i will be glad to retract if anyone is miffed the article makes four main points NUMBER absence of critical clauses in this case the idea is that the licence is invalid because it doesn t specify under what country s law the gpl is governed NUMBER specification in english only that for the end user as opposed to businesses the gpl doesn t apply because it s not written in french NUMBER arbitary licence change the point here is that under french law the author can change the terms of the licence arbitarily this is because any granting of rights by an author must be clearly delimited in terms of how long where to whom dates and times in the absence of such limitations the original author has the right to change his software back to closed on a whim david neary makes the point that the copyright holder automatically retains the right to change the licence scott replies it simply requires authorisation from all copyright holders that s not my understanding french law allows a gpl type licence _on condition_ that the specific conditions of the granting of such rights are clear if they are not there is nothing to stop the original author taking back his work the lawyers see this correctly imho as a weakness in the gpl NUMBER hidden defects roughly this clause means that the author s is are liable for any defects if the consumer is not an it engineer so if linux blows up and data is lost then the authors are liable ciaran johnson says that m oft and others have similar clauses the point here is that they are _all_ invalid just that this one affects the gpl also niall o broinn makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a service leasing arrangement and that s why it doesn t come under this point i would suggest that the whole thrust of this article has been to see software sales even if no money changes hands as governed very much by consumer law in france anyway rick moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting of rights which are not default see the bit about even the granting of rights by an author having to be explicitly specified under french law the fact that two ip lawyers in france think that the gpl is covered as a sale make me feel that there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract NUMBER roughly there may be other reasons under french law why the gpl may be invalid whole article freedom a is worth more than these imperfect licences specialised lawyers look at the gpl lawyer cyril rojinsky duly appointed to the court and the jurist vincent grynbaum both specialised in the area of intellectual property examine the free licences and in particular the gpl they have published their study in the review proprietes intellectuelles intellectual property NUMBER and their conclusion is grim their approach is interesting the problem for them is not to know whether freedom is valid under french law for them the question is a moot point but rather they asked themselves about the form and the content of the text of free licences and in particular the gpl the problem is not free programmes but rather the licence contracts of free programmes absence of critical clauses the authors tell us that first of all the reference to copyright is not legally sufficient in the framework of international contracts which is the case of licence contracts for programmes developed and spread via the internet the idea of copyright can basically include differences from one country to another this is why under international contracts it is necessary to specify to which laws one is referring french law american c the authors only found three public licences which were correctly formulated on this point qpl ibm public licence and the mozilla public licence specification in the english language next the authors remind us that at least in france no clause in a contract may be contrary to french law NUMBER however it turns out that a licence such as the gpl is contrary to french law in several respects firstly it is written in english and the fsf doesn t officially approve translations the toubon law obliges this sort of contract to be written in french including for businesses since the notion of user applies not only to consumers but also to businesses professionals c contacted by the editors of linuxfrench lawyer cyril rojinsky declared that as far as business is concerned the toubon law is probably doomed to change since it is in contradiction of european directives on the subject but whatever about that the problem is still valid for individuals and while waiting for it french law to change french companies have to deal with it since it is the law of the land a programme under the gpl can suddenly change licence another problem much more serious is that according to french law the author of a free programme can at any time invoke the invalidity of the licence for this software by simply changing the licence in effect the law of intellectual property stipulates that the granting of rights by the author is subordinate to the condition that each of these granted rights be the object of a distinct clause in the granting act i e the licence and that the granting of any such rights be delimited with respect to its scope and its grantees and also with respect to its location i e where such rights may be excersised and duration of any such grants NUMBER this is not the case of the gpl nor of other free licences briefly this means that in france or elsewhere if the author is french that which is under the gpl could revert to proprietary from one day to the next the problem of the guarantee hidden defects an other very serious flaw is that of the guarantee the gpl licences and others show that the software is delivered without guarantee you are going to immediately reply that commercical programmes carry the same clause in their licence contracts and this is correct however whatever is written in a licence contract one cannot free oneself from the guarantee from hidden defects since it is imposed in the civil code this concept is poorly understood by the layman it protects the buyer whoever it may be individual or business since it specifies the civil code and not consumer protection law against hidden defects deliberate or made in good faith by the seller for example if one buys a pair of socks in a sale and the shop has a notice specifying that sale items are neither refunded nor exchanged and on arriving home you notice that one of the socks has a hole in it several scenarios are possible you could have checked the socks before purchase the flaw is deemed obvious and you can sing for your money you couldn t check the socks they were packaged for example and in this case despite the notice neither refund nor exchange you may invoke hidden defect and have them changed or obtain a refund it s up to you personally i have already invoked in shops the hidden defect clause and it always worked well shopkeepers are always very cooperative if you quote a couple of words of the civil code the concept of hidden defect is rather wide it is necessary that you hadn t the possibility of discovering the defect before buying the product and then according to the civil code that you wouldn t have bought it at that price if you had known about the defect the third case which is much rarer is if you are able to show that the vendor had knowledge of the defect hidden but didn t inform you in this case not only does he have to reimburse the product but all expenses incurred by the sale metro tickets to go to the shop the fuse which blew when you plugged it in c this idea of hidden defect applies to all products including programmes this was made abundantly clear by the authorities and the courts surrounding yNUMBERk this is particularly inconvenient for free programmes since a site which offers a linux distro for download is supposed to provide a guarantee against hidden flaws linuxfrench asked cyril rojinsky if in the case of a free programme one could speak about a hidden defect since the source code was available he replied actually concerning the guarantee the question of obvious defect will arise this analyis will be different depending on whether the person who downloads the distribution is an it professional or not opensource has this advantage over the proprietary programme it protects the distributor against a guarantee of hidden defect insofar as the buy is an it person but for distribution to the public at large the problem remains the same roughly speaking lawyer cyril rojinsky said it himself this study is far from being exhaustive and many other areas could be explored during this interview we asked ourselves for example about the fragility of the gpl clause which forbids linking source code under the gpl with proprietary code in effect the laws of intellectual property give the right to the user to modify a programme with the intention of permitting interoperability with another programme if for that i need to link with a proprietary library communication protocol device driver i may consider as null and void this clause of the gpl the conclusion of this study is a wake up call for the community freedom merits more than these shoddy licences which should be modified before court cases over them proliferate and put at risk the undeniable originality of this effort NUMBER une publication de l institut de recherche en propriété intellectuelle noNUMBER juillet NUMBER NUMBER une telle clause de contrat qui est opposée à ce que dit la loi française est qualifiée en terme juridique de clause réputée non écrite c est à dire qu on fait comme si cette clause n était pas écrite dans le contrat

david bonderman a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation for fixing problem companies mr siegel once a top executive at continental airlines had watched texas pacific s partners turn an investment of NUMBER million in the airline made three years after it filed for bankruptcy in NUMBER into a profit of more than NUMBER million and they had made nearly as much on their stake in america west which filed for bankruptcy in NUMBER that search for advice turned into an offer why not let texas pacific have a role in us airways revival asked richard schifter the texas pacific executive whom mr siegel reached in june mr siegel called mr schifter again and days before us airways announced its plans to file for bankruptcy two weeks ago but after it had negotiated about NUMBER million in concessions with its unions texas pacific based in fort worth and san francisco agreed to kick in NUMBER million as part of a NUMBER million loan to keep the company operating during bankruptcy it also agreed to buy NUMBER million of stock or NUMBER percent of the company and take NUMBER of NUMBER seats on the board if us airways emerges from bankruptcy unless another investor surfaces with a better offer one of the reasons we were interested is few other folks were said james coulter a partner at texas pacific in an interview after the bankruptcy filing there aren t many people around with the stomach or the knowledge to delve into the airline industry texas pacific which manages NUMBER billion thrives by buying businesses no one else wants mr coulter and mr bonderman made their names during the recession of the early NUMBER s with investments in continental and america west the firm s hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping companies sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its extensive network of contacts for talented replacements now the partners are again looking for trouble in the last year alone texas pacific has announced or completed six acquisitions most in unloved industries like semiconductors reinsurance and airlines just last month it announced plans to buy burger king which has been losing market share for NUMBER NUMBER billion it is also bidding for bankgesellschaft berlin a large and troubled bank the most creative and potentially lucrative of these deals could be texas pacific s acquisition last november of memc electronic materials a semiconductor company for NUMBER yes just NUMBER in cash it will also guarantee a NUMBER million bank loan in the last few years most firms that specialize in leveraged buyouts the use of junk bonds bank loans and other borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies have been largely inactive falling stock prices have made managements reluctant to sell cheaply companies that are for sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze texas pacific is different this is a terrific environment for them said stephen schwarzman chief executive of the blackstone group which also specializes in buyouts mark attanasio a managing director at trust company of the west which has invested with texas pacific said most other buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing you don t see many guys wanting to take on operational fixes like most other buyout firms texas pacific tries to keep its inner workings private its partners rarely grant interviews and its web site is perpetually under construction mr bonderman mr coulter and william price the third founding partner declined to be interviewed for this article mr bonderman NUMBER is known for his rumpled shirts and bright patterned socks he likes argyle socks and they tend to fall down around his ankles said henry miller an investment banker who advises troubled companies early in his career when he was a washington lawyer mr bonderman argued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit when a texas pacific deal is being negotiated he is known for obsessively staying in touch even when he is trekking in places like pakistan nepal and most recently bhutan whenever i see a long unfamiliar phone number pop up on my caller i d i know it s david calling said one investment banker who often works with mr bonderman mr bonderman made his reputation in the NUMBER s as the chief investment officer for robert bass the texas oilman mr bonderman enriched mr bass a second time by making early bets in industries like cable television and taking stakes in troubled companies like american savings loan which had been seized by the government over nearly a decade mr bonderman s picks earned an average annual return of NUMBER percent for mr bass in NUMBER mr bonderman struck out on his own with mr coulter a former lehman brothers banker who had also worked for mr bass they teamed up later that year with mr price a veteran of ge capital capital and bain company a consulting firm to form texas pacific the three men have complementary skills investment bankers and other deal makers said mr bonderman is the master strategist and mr coulter is good at structuring deals and the detailed management of the firm s purchases mr price often recruits managers and advises on operational issues david is very much the optimist very much the deal maker said greg brenneman a former president of continental jim is very much a counterbalance to david he will sit back and ask the tough questions he will approach investments a little bit more skeptically than david does by the end of the NUMBER s texas pacific was well established in deal making it easily raised NUMBER NUMBER billion from pension funds and other investors in early NUMBER to celebrate their war chest the firm s partners rented san francisco s city hall and hired the b NUMBER s to play at a party but as the stock market began to tumble texas pacific hesitated for a NUMBER month stretch the partners made no deals they checked out some of the biggest corporate blowups including adelphia xerox and global crossing but stayed away finding the prices and the quality of the businesses untenable instead texas pacific began to hastily exit some existing investments taking more than NUMBER billion in profits during that stretch they started to cash out early in the cycle said mario giannini chief executive of hamilton lane a money management firm some of whose clients are texas pacific investors the good times of the late NUMBER s were not ideal for texas pacific it struggled to find downtrodden companies that needed its help but texas pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the rough it revived oxford health plans the health maintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the mid NUMBER s almost doubling its money after bringing in new managers and upgrading computer systems in NUMBER it made a NUMBER million investment in ducati motor the italian motorcycle maker whose profits have since more than quadrupled but texas pacific also stumbled usually when it bought at the top of the market texas pacific s NUMBER million investment in the j crew group the clothing retailer for which it paid a steep price of NUMBER times cash flow in NUMBER has been a disappointment so has its NUMBER purchase of bally the shoe maker which has suffered from lower demand for luxury goods texas pacific also lost more than NUMBER million on zilog a semiconductor company and favorite brands a candy maker both of which filed for bankruptcy some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm s performance texas pacific is still selling off holdings in two investment funds it raised over the last decade the first fund a NUMBER million portfolio raised in NUMBER and including investments made through march NUMBER should return more than NUMBER percent according to one texas pacific investor but its second fund NUMBER NUMBER billion raised in NUMBER could return less than half that this investor estimated since the firm had less time to take profits on these investments before the stock market sank but because texas pacific has not sold many of its holdings in the second fund profits on these investments could rebound it is hoping for example that with new management in place j crew will turn around as the economy rebounds in any case one competitor said their returns look pretty good when you consider that some other funds won t return any capital to investors but with the weak economy throwing many companies into trouble texas pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier success the investor said they should do exceptionally well he said texas pacific has a distinct style if not formula it relies on talented self sufficient managers to restructure troubled companies preferring to remain hands off except for surveillance from the boardroom when necessary it replaces managers less than a year after continental emerged from bankruptcy for example mr bonderman watched with frustration as his old friend robert r ferguson the chief executive led it to the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court continental s board where mr bonderman was chairman then brought in gordon m bethune an executive at boeing and in october NUMBER he replaced mr ferguson as chief executive mr bethune quickly did a top to bottom overhaul of the company and is now considered a great turnaround artist of the industry the biggest conflict i ve ever seen was with bob ferguson said

ham, begin pgp signed message hash shaNUMBER thugs of south boston and the revenge of the bandit princess the geodesic economy robert a hettinga sunday august NUMBER NUMBER boston when you think about it one way the fbi winter hill vs patriarcha angiulo cosa nostra fight was just another race war between thugs put crudely and at its most racist the fbi and the winter hill gang were the mostly irish thugs and patriarcha s family were of course the mostly italian thugs think scorsese s upcoming gangs of new york only with counter reformatory overtones hoover s south boston social club putsch starting in the mid NUMBER s was particularly audacious in hindsight the u s federal government actually decided to underwrite a reversal of the prohibition era capture of the nation s rackets by the italians from the irish the fact that the plot was hatched not for new york but for south boston the most irish place in the us only makes even more gigantic the big lie that was told by the fbi to its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime there once and for all the result as we all found out wasn t swapping the heroin of italian boston mob violence for irish methadone hoover was posthumously swapping it for oxycontin or crystal methamphetamine or more properly pcp the absolute psychopathology of violence in whitey bulger s crack cocaine era reign of boston s drug markets like the identical fbi sponsored reigns or violent horror by other also rans in cities across the us as a whole went up whole orders of magnitude not mere percentage points as stalin said once quantity has a quality all it s own and make no mistake j edgar hoover was directly responsible that quality of carnage nation wide so yes on paper at least it really was just the swapping of one gang of racist thugs for another and the result was on paper at least business as usual same stuff different century with apparently decent people like mr salvati URL accidently ground on the gears of justice like so much hamburger however to be much more macabre about it that hamburger was greasing if you will an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could love a perfectly functioning market legislated out of existence on paper if nowhere else by government fiat and the back door but still elitist will to power of h l mencken s famous bluenoses and busybodies it all starts like all true evil does from the most innocent of beginnings what she couldn t do to alcohol teatotaling mrs grundy then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a smaller manageable demand the bloody result was like nine more heads of the hydra an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition in more markets and for more things as the NUMBERth century wore on every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive or harmful or physically distasteful or carcinogenic or now apparently fattening and then prohibited exactly the same thing happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the volstead years a larger market than before the prohibition hugely lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently scale newly legislated barriers to competition imposed on them by the state increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of those substances and finally the ultimate in evil the kind of evil this country actually fought wars to end increasingly coercive axe handle beatings by our own government of the sacred liberty of the average but now unavoidably law breaking citizenry as ayn rand cynically observed a long time ago you don t need government if nobody s breaking the law in some twisted corollary to parkinson s law governments to survive need more people breaking more laws or they can never justify the money they confiscate at tax time and to bring us back to the point david friedman would probably echo here his father milton s famous observation that government regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market and never the consumer much less the economy as a whole even especially if those sellers are breaking the law as they are in the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our government now imposes on us and there absent the apparent grace of mr hoover went mr salvati in fact hayek himself in the road to serfdom couldn t have predicted any better the gory consequences of hoover s blatant imposition for our own good of vietnam era statist power at the neighborhood level and furthermore stalin couldn t have had better useful idiots than hoover did and neither by an absolutely literal extension did whitey bulger after hoover useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle idiots who were eating out of hoover s power craven hand for the entire middle of the NUMBERth century and whitey bulger s hand whether they knew it or not until the end of the millennium a time you ll notice which saw the increasingly steady imposition of mob violence and market control from both state and illegal interests way beyond the imaginings of even the most power mad rum running stock kiting movie flopping bureau pumping nazi appeasing irish bostonian little caesar or as for that matter his safely trust funded and now strictly political descendents in terms of actual financial economics think of what happened to mr salvati and the others dead or alive as a transfer price in human lives of the inevitable consequence of macnamara style vietnam era keynesian social cost input output accounting at its most despicable and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that was committed by hoover and his co religionists in state economic control in the name of what really was as you ll now agree just a race war between thugs up in boston this shouldn t be a surprise really all race wars are at least fought by thugs though they re usually conceived elsewhere and endorsed at the time by all the right people for all the right reasons as far as the fbi itself goes remember mancur olson s observation that a prince is just a stationary bandit though given his penchant for women s clothing for other men and what s actually obscene for violently hypocritical treatment of people of his own affectional preference i suppose we can call j edgar hoover a bandit princess instead bandit queen of course would be a grievous insult to queens and real bandits everywhere cheers rah URL pagewanted print position top the new york times august NUMBER NUMBER hoover s f b i and the mafia case of bad bedfellows grows by fox butterfield boston aug NUMBER it was march NUMBER in the early days of j edgar hoover s war against the mafia f b i agents say congressional investigators eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of new england s organized crime boss raymond patriarca two gangsters joseph barboza and vincent flemmi wanted mr patriarca s permission to kill a small time hoodlum edward deegan as they were having a problem with him according to an f b i log of the conversation patriarca ultimately furnished this o k the f b i reported and three days later mr deegan turned up dead in an alley shot six times it was an extraordinary situation the federal bureau of investigation had evidence ahead of time that two well known gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the new england mafia was involved but when indictments in the case were handed down in NUMBER the real killers who also happened to be informers for the f b i were left alone four other men were tried convicted and sentenced to death or life in prison for the murder though they had had nothing to do with it one joseph salvati who spent NUMBER years in prison filed notice with the justice department last week that he planned to sue the f b i for NUMBER million for false imprisonment his is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the f b i the justice department and some f b i agents growing out of the tangled corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the f b i s boston office in its effort to bring down the mob the lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years in a judicial hearing and a justice department inquiry but some of the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light including documents detailing conversation in which mr patriarca approved the murder they were released as part of an investigation by the house committee on government reform which has pressured the department into turning over records about the f b i in boston the documents show that officials at f b i headquarters apparently including mr hoover knew as long ago as NUMBER that boston agents were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were protecting them from prosecution j edgar hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal himself said vincent garo mr salvati s lawyer he allowed a witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect one of his informants mr barboza was a crucial witness at trial against mr salvati and may have implicated him because mr salvati owed NUMBER to a loan shark who worked for mr barboza asked about the documents showing that mr hoover knew of mr salvati s innocence when he was put on trial gail marcinkiewicz a spokeswoman for the f b i in boston declined to comment citing the pending litigation a justice department task force is continuing to investigate misconduct in the boston office in one of the first results of the investigation one retired agent john j connolly is awaiting sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were f b i informers james bulger and stephen flemmi vincent and stephen flemmi are brothers the government reform committee led by representative dan burton republican of indiana has uncovered memorandums from the boston office to headquarters in washington revealing the bureau s knowledge that vincent flemmi and mr barboza were involved in killing mr deegan a memorandum a week after the killing described the crime including who fired the first shot then on june NUMBER NUMBER mr hoover s office demanded to know what progress was being made in developing vincent flemmi as an informer in a reply five days later the special agent in charge of the boston office said that mr flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot wounds but because of his connections to mr patriarca potentially could be an excellent informant the agent also informed mr hoover that mr flemmi was known to have killed seven men and from all indications he is going to continue to commit murder nevertheless the agent said the informant s potential outweighs the risk involved a congressional investigator called the exchange chilling the most frightening part is that after being warned about flemmi s murders the director does not even respond the investigator said there is no message not to use a murderer as a government informant the origin of the corruption scandal was public and political pressure on mr hoover to move more forcefully against the growing power of the mafia which he had largely ignored in boston f b i agents recruited mr barboza and mr flemmi and developed close ties to a rival criminal organization the winter hill gang led by mr bulger both sides got what they wanted according to the investigations and the trial of mr connolly the f b i got information that eventually helped destroy the patriarca and angiulo families which controlled organized crime in new england mr bulger s gang was able to take over the rackets in boston sell drugs and even commit murder while the f b i looked the other way one reason the f b i may not have used its information about mr patriarca s involvement in the deegan murder congressional investigators say is that it came from an illegal listening device in his providence r i headquarters the f b i agent who transcribed the

ham,right mike i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart my opinion is only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications instant show that we cross easily though you are right as rain on pricing i am mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways once there are a billion eye s which can instantly share what they see amongst each other that doesn t mean that people will stop talking on their phones or that people will spend more time w images than voice just that it is fundamental from news to crime to privacy to dating to family life to bloopers and practical jokes i believe there will be an explosion of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of photography by orders of magnitude and in short order and yes changes things big time rgds rob original message from

NUMBER NUMBER pm NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER rob shavell wrote content who cares about content that no one can think of useful content is always the business persons mistake the content is the users communications its anything and everything avg person could easily send half dozen pics to a dozen people a day mainly humorous i d guess who cares if content is trivial in nature picture speaks a thousand words this does nothing to answer my question i do care about content hell if i could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day i d have a different opinion of this i just am not convinced that they will stupid or not while a picture may be worth a thousand words and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made how many people do you know who communicate by pictures sure it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something i don t buy it for most messages text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism for some messages pictures do the job but i would say not nearly as often as words why do you think pictionary and charades and such are games because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across misc ramblings i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same thing about NUMBER hour photo processing trivial who needs it i get better resultion elswhere and yet it had great decentralizing impact the plant had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation the digital camera and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion which will put the photo giants to bed and change the world in a meaningful way also sms didn t take off because its easy it took off because it costs less its greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the profitabilty of their sms traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth in reality sms cannibilizes the voice rev s they bought their networks to handle again this is the same argument my colleague made along with you just don t understand kids today and they ll run with this i wasn t saying that mms wouldn t take off because it wasn t high quality or that it wasn t easy i was saying that i couldn t see why people would use it in a way that changed the face of communications i m looking for the compelling reason even if it s a stupid one why people would want to do this sure if they integrate cameras into the phone and the quality improves even only marginally i can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people but mostly i don t see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someone s email address or putting together an online or offline photoalbum i don t think NUMBER hour photos are trivial people want to see their own pics right away and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots that s one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on the instant view part i m guessing your argument is that people not only want instant view but also instant show which is what this service offers i m not convinced that most people want instant show i think people like to package their pictures and show them that s why people put together fancy albums and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture sure occasionally instant show is nice but it s just nice on occasion i still can t see how it becomes a integral messaging method what s the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another there has to be some benefit even if it s silly if people are going to flock to it i m searching no one has given me a straight answer yet the only really intriguing idea i ve heard about things like mms lately are dan gillmor s assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones from all different angles and those photos tell the real story of what happened before the press even gets there willing to be proven wrong mike ps if the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are then mms is never going to catch on URL

ham,hi kragen this is an interesting analysis i think that there are a couple of nits i might pick for example i don t expect that the market will be well developed with highest bidders for while i think that the most important issue which is that end users won t be able to fix their systems is almost passed over i know that you know this and you allude to it but your essay is getting passed around so you might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others there s one other point which you don t make which i think is very important which is that research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can t happen without libraries of available vulnerability code i can think of three researchers into automated methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped uninvited about the quality of the existing vulnerability sites doing research into a set requires that you have enough examples in the open that you can define a set and that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test predictions i feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure we wouldn t have stackguard itsNUMBER nissus or snort and the security admin s job would be a lot harder adam on thu aug NUMBER NUMBER at NUMBER NUMBER NUMBERam NUMBER eugen leitl wrote eugen leitl a href URL leitl a ______________________________________________________________

on august NUMBERth an entity known as idefense sent out an announcement which is appended to this email briefly idefense which bills itself as a global security intelligence company is offering cash for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software that are not publicly known especially if you promise not to tell anyone else if this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue it will pose a very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure at the moment the dominant paradigm for computer security research known as full disclosure people who discover security vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them and a short while later after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem they publish the information including code to exploit the vulnerability if possible this method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by cert in the late NUMBERs which its proponents might call responsible disclosure never release working exploit code and never release any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released a patch this procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked on features and often even after the patches were released people wouldn t apply them because they didn t know how serious the problem was the underground computer criminal community would often discover and exploit these same holes for months or years while the responsible disclosure process kept their victims who had no connections in the underground vulnerable the problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known are much less dangerous because their victims can take steps to reduce their potential impact including disabling software turning off vulnerable features filtering traffic in transit and detecting and responding to intrusions they are therefore much less useful to would be intruders also software companies usually see security vulnerabilities in their software as pr problems and so prefer to delay publication and the expense of fixing the bugs as long as possible idefense is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous than either of the two previous paradigms they want to be a buyer in a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information rewarding discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash not long before snosoft a group of security researchers evidently including some criminal elements apparently made an offer to sell the secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software vendor specifically they apparently made a private offer to hewlett packard to keep a vulnerability in hp s truNUMBER unix secret if hp retained snosoft s consulting services hp considered this extortion and responded with legal threats and snosoft published the information if this is allowed to happen it will cause two problems which together add up to a catastrophe first secret software vulnerability information will be available to the highest bidder and to nobody else for reasons explained later i think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime syndicates although that will not be obvious to the sellers second finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will become lucrative for many more talented people the result will be just as in the responsible disclosure days that the good guys will remain vulnerable for months and years while the majority of current vulnerabilities are kept secret i ve heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the vendors of the vulnerable software but i don t think that s plausible if someone can steal NUMBER NUMBER because a software bug lets them the software vendor is never held liable often in fact the people who administer the software aren t liable either when credit card data are stolen from an e commerce site for example knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web site administrator some time and it might save the software vendor some negative pr but it can net the thief thousands of dollars i think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability information is most lucrative the thieves who can use it to execute the largest heists without getting caught inevitably that means organized crime syndicates although the particular gangs who are good at networked theft may not yet exist there might be the occasional case where a market leader such as microsoft could make more money by giving their competitors bad pr than a gang could make by theft think of a remote root hole in samba for example right now people who know how to find security exploits are either motivated by personal interest in the subject motivated by the public interest motivated by a desire for individual recognition or personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits creating a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly increase the availability of that information to the people who can afford to pay the most for it spies terrorists and organized crime let s not let that happen

greetings idefense is pleased to announce the official launch of its vulnerability contributor program vcp the vcp pays contributors for the advance notification of vulnerabilities exploit code and malicious code idefense hopes you might consider contributing to the vcp the following provides answers to some basic questions about the program q how will it work a idefense understands the majority of security researchers do not publish security research for compensation rather it could be for any of a number of motivations including the following pure love of security research the desire to protect against harm to targeted networks the desire to urge vendors to fix their products the publicity that often accompanies disclosure the vcp is for those who want to have their research made public to the internet community but who would also like to be paid for doing the work the compensation will depend among other things on the following items the kind of information being shared i e vulnerability or exploit the amount of detail and analysis provided the potential severity level for the information shared the types of applications operating systems and other software and hardware potentially affected verification by idefense labs the level of exclusivity if any for data granted to idefense q who should contribute to the vcp a the vcp is open to any individual security research group or other entity q why are you launching this program a timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence contributions to some lists take time before publication to the public at large more often many of these services charge clients for access without paying the original contributor under the idefense program the contributor is compensated idefense labs verifies the issue and idefense clients and the public at large are warned in a timely manner q who gets the credit a the contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or exploit information q when can i

ham, bottom line the late senate minority leader certainly would have endorsed the meaning behind the phrase but it is questionable that he ever coined it an interesting link courtesy of the harrow report there s no written evidence so far that senator everett dirksen is the source of the infamous quote attributed to him it s kind of astounding that there is enough general social consensus NUMBER of all queries makes it a very faq and eyewitness reporting without a single written source what the essay below doesn t seem to answer though is what the earliest attributed quote in print by any other writer is i d naturally be much more skeptical if the quote emerged after his death rk URL a billion here a billion there did dirksen ever say a billion here a billion there and pretty soon you re talking real money or anything very close to that perhaps not based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio records of the dirksen congressional center staffers there have found no evidence that dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to him archivists undertook the search after studying research statistics showing that more than NUMBER percent of inquiries have to do with the quote or its variations here is what they examined all of the existing audio tapes of the famed ev and charlie and ev and jerry shows all newspapers clippings in the dirksen papers about NUMBER NUMBER pages of dirksen s own speech notes transcripts of his speeches and media appearances transcripts of republican leadership press conferences and dirksen s statements on the senate floor as documented in the congressional record although dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech preferring to rely on notes he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular turn of phrase for example in referring to the public debt or excessive government spending dirksen would jot the word pothole to remind him to tell the following story on this occasion in reference to the debt ceiling as i think of this bill and the fact that the more progress we make the deeper we go into the hole i am reminded of a group of men who were working on a street they had dug quite a number of holes when they got through they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to the hole and they had a nice little mound which was quite a traffic hazard not knowing what to do with it they sat down on the curb and had a conference after a while one of the fellows snapped his fingers and said i have it i know how we will get rid of that overriding earth and remove the hazard we will just dig the hole deeper congressional record june NUMBER NUMBER p NUMBER on the same occasion dirksen relied on yet another spending story one he labeled cat in the well one time in the house of representatives a colleague told me a story about a proposition that a teacher put to a boy he said johnny a cat fell in a well NUMBER feet deep suppose that cat climbed up NUMBER foot and then fell back NUMBER feet how long would it take the cat to get out of the well johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a while and then when the teacher came down and said how are you getting along johnny said teacher if you give me another slate and a couple of slate pencils i am pretty sure that in the next NUMBER minutes i can land that cat in hell if some people get any cheer our of a NUMBER billion debt ceiling i do not find much to cheer about concerning it congressional record june NUMBER NUMBER p NUMBER but there are no such reminders for the a billion here a billion there tag line as there surely should have been given dirksen s note making tendencies he spoke often and passionately about the debt ceiling federal spending and the growth of government yet there is no authoritative reference to the billion phrase the chief evidence in support of dirksen making the statement comes from people who claim to have heard him the library of congress for example cites someone s personal observation on the campaign trail as evidence the dirksen center has received calls from people who heard dirksen say those words some even providing the date of the event but cross checking that information with the records has so far turned up nothing in the way of confirmation the closest documented statement came at a joint senate house republican leadership press conference on march NUMBER NUMBER when dirksen said the favorite sum of money is NUMBER billion a billion a year for a fatter federal payroll a billion here a billion there emd papers republican congressional leadership file f NUMBER but the and pretty soon you re talking real money is missing in another close call the new york times january NUMBER NUMBER quoted dirksen look at education two and one half billion a billion for this a billion for that a billion for something else three to five billion for public works you haven t got any budget balance left you ll be deeply in the red cited in byron hulsey s everett dirksen and the modern presidents ph d dissertation may NUMBER university of texas p NUMBER of course the dirksen papers do not document completely the late senator s comments for example the center that bears his name does not have his testimony before committees their collection of congressional records ends in NUMBER omitting the last four years of dirksen s life and career he might have employed the phrase only late although witnesses claim he said it throughout his career dirksen s campaign speeches tended not to produce transcripts only sketchy notes or abbreviated newspaper accounts dirksen also held center stage before the video age meaning that many remarks particularly those in campaigns escaped capture bottom line the late senate minority leader certainly would have endorsed the meaning behind the phrase but it is questionable that he ever coined it my permanent email address is khare URL

enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has come to a halt the number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell NUMBER percent in NUMBER according to a report by the computing research association and educators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating with some colleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins the word is out among department deans that the bust s fallout has trickled into the classroom said maria clavez president of the association of computing machinery i ve heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic declines said clavez who will become the dean of science and engineering at princeton university in january it can be hard to see this because at some colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far exceeds the available space but it is going to have an effect at virginia tech enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science department will drop NUMBER percent this year to NUMBER at george washington university the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer science fell by more than half this year interest in undergraduate computer

NUMBER with other computer related industries trailing close behind but in the short term that growth may slow based on the changes among college students for example NUMBER of the NUMBER NUMBER plus undergraduates studying information technology and engineering at george mason university were computer science majors last year this year the enrollment in that major is down to NUMBER although a newly created and more general information technology major has attracted NUMBER students having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief said lloyd griffith dean of george mason s information

were always fun so i looked for professions in which i could use those things yandziak said i m just not sure i want my life to be immersed in technology i want to do something that will contribute to the practical world harris n miller president of the information technology association of america said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage there was a tremendous imbalance in the late NUMBERs potentially you have the same sort of thing going on right now people are saying i don t need this kind of it training right now miller said our concern as an industry is that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment down the road four years as the economy picks up once again companies are going to find themselves in a shortage situation economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices but other factors including program difficulty personal interests and social

wrote this thread kind of surprises me i started coding with c then c and moved on to java and i think that robert harley wrote looks like a case of my experience is comprehensive your s is anecdotal they don t know what they re talking about well i sure don t claim that i think most people on fork probably have more programming knowledge than i do there s lots of experience out here reza b far wrote NUMBER the people who pay the wages don t give a flyin heck what programming language you write things in they just want it to work robert harley wrote in my experience they do care it has to work certainly and in particular it has to work with what they ve already got and it has to work on client s systems my limited experience of java started a few years ago when support on linux was so terrible that i ran away screaming and haven t come back yet well i think until recently support for most things on linux was kind of shady things have got much better you re right in that the jdk used to suck on linux but then imho linux is still maturing or at least development tools for linux are maturing i ve been developing a few server side apps that run on linux recently with jdk NUMBER NUMBER x and they ve had no problems with great performance robert harley worte microsoft has announced that they plan to remove java from windows they took it out of xp already and it has to be installed with a service pack somehow i can t imagine them removing the ability to run c programs hmmm do you really think that ms is pulling out java because it s a bad programming language or application platform you don t think this has anything to do with net being a competitor to java do you or that ms has basically copied java with some additional features and called it c isn t that alone an indication that they actually do think that a vm is the right way to go for most high level applications reza b far wrote NUMBER c and c forces the developer to solve problems such as memory management over and over again robert harley wrote can t say i spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management issues apart from the fact that i frequently need NUMBER gb hmmm again you re telling me that you ve never had a nasty bug that took you a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak i am not the best c c programmer not even close but i ve known really good ones and even they have nasty bugs that have to do with memory management however occasional they may be it s about design patterns architecture high level stuff robert harley wrote if your problem just requires application of a design pattern to solve then it s trivial anyway irrespective of language wow so you re telling me that unless the application involves bit counting it s trivial what about the application itself what about high level problems such as task distribution work flow etc aren t most high level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal c c code for example do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks there are lots of them on this list are working on writing an operating system with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment i am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low level problems that have been solved NUMBER million times over and over and over again robert harley wrote you appear to be gratuitously asserting that c programmers waste time on irrelevant low level problems and java programmers don t depends entirely on the programmer not the language i can see how you could infer this however what i believe to really be the case is that java is one of the best languages for writing large applications with many components that involves the collaboration of more than three programmers in those cases it s always very hard to get the programmers to agree on api s memory management techniques etc with java the jcp takes care of the discussions so that you don t sit around in a long meeting trying to decide what api to use to hook up to a database jdbc or a messaging bus jms NUMBER java is not just a programming language it s also a platform robert harley wrote buzzword yikes have you written db code with c c for different databases just an example tried porting a persistence layer from windows to unix say you have informix running on solaris and you want to port to windows with ms sql bad idea but for the sake of the example would you rather deal with jdbc port or c c port that uses informix drivers and now you have to use odbc a monolithic set of api s or a crap load of different api s slicing and dicing the same problems NUMBER different ways robert harley wrote unsupported assertion so are you saying that there is a standard set of api s for c c for everything aside to the minimal ansi stuff is there a standard way of dealing with c c applications for various domain problems messaging database persistence etc that rivals java i d like to know if there is one accepted by everyone who writes c c in that case i claim ignorance not suggesting that java is the golden hammer just that c c is overkill for most things i even coded in vb but vb is a true disgrace to programming it s just lame java is object oriented no flame mail from the anti oo people please that is a religious discussion and relatively clean and i don t think that every kid can write a well designed java program kids typically don t understand various design patterns and principles to my experience they actually tend to think more of the low level problems wanting to rewrite and reinvent the world a tendency that is much more possible imho in c c than in java due to existence of standard api s

being able to surf the net at speeds faster than dsl from anywhere at any time you could watch a live video webcast while waiting for the bus email photos to your friends while sitting in the park or download the mpNUMBER of the song that s playing in the pub before it finishes this is the vision of a high speed wireless internet paradise that the third generation NUMBERg mobile phone companies have been promoting for years NUMBERg services are just beginning to be rolled out but a new technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever dream two companies us startup meshnetworks and moteran networks of germany are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking instead of the current hub and spoke model of wireless communications with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna any time mesh enabled devices mobile phones pdas laptops are in close proximity to each other they automatically create a wireless mesh network every device in the area acts as a repeater or router relaying traffic for everyone else traffic hops from person to person until it reaches the nearest internet access point reducing the need for central antennas and improving wireless coverage as the number of mobile phones soars and wireless pdas laptops and other devices begin to crowd the spectrum this approach to wireless networking may be inevitable mesh networks also have several other advantages over NUMBERg wireless networks while NUMBERg operators roll out mobile services that offer users connection speeds of up to NUMBER kbps roughly three times faster than a dial up modem moteran and meshnetworks are able to offer connection speeds of up to NUMBERmbps over a hundred times faster than dial up the technologies they use include wi fi the emerging standard for high speed wireless networking also known as NUMBER NUMBERb a similarly short range protocol called ultrawideband which is poised to succeed wi fi is even faster and could by NUMBER approach NUMBER mbps the range of a typical wi fi network is generally too limited to be of much use when travelling around a city mesh networks get around the problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic even though the range of any individual device is relatively small because in theory there will be so many users in the surrounding area connections will be faster and better than that of a standard NUMBERg wireless connection because mesh networks use wi fi the equipment and infrastructure needed to create them is cheap and readily available instead of building cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds all that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points around NUMBER now placed strategically around town to relay traffic and the proper software existing laptops and pdas can be mesh enabled by software it also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network unlike with NUMBERg cellular the part of the spectrum that wi fi operates on is unregulated in the us britain the mobile phone companies are none too pleased about this especially since many of them spent billions of pounds acquiring NUMBERg licences all that s needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect to the network with every additional customer that signs up coverage gets better instead of getting worse as is the case with mobile phone networks but things get very interesting when you realise that when you have high speed internet connections everywhere and everyone s laptops pdas and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds sharing music movies or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy when ultrawideband hits all of this will just accelerate at NUMBERmbps copying a pirated copy of the lord of the rings from the person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about NUMBER seconds sooner or later playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of their favourite songs movies and video games but the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers meshnetworks has no plans to offer its own high speed wireless service instead the company plans to sell its technology to others such as cities that want to provide wireless internet to police fire and public works employees or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the cheap moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for enterprise networks the first place average users may use the technology is when it is incorporated into vehicles enabling motorists to access the internet at high speeds which both companies see happening soon when will you be able to wander around town with a NUMBERmbps connection in your pocket it s too soon to say but just as broadband internet service was initially available only to businesses and universities eventually someone will see the profit in bringing

ham,definitional nit to pick robert harley writes it is perfectly obvious that heterosexual promiscuity is exactly precisely identical between males and females of course the shapes of the distributions may differ you ve redefined promiscuity above as total or average activity which seems to rob it of its common meaning activity above some specific threshold usually one or norm or involving extra or indiscriminate variety promiscuity is thus inherently a description of distributions rather than averages consider a population of NUMBER males and NUMBER females let there be three pairings which result in each person having sex once then let one of the males also have sex with the other two females sure the average number of sex acts and sex partners is equal between the sexes tautologically but here more women than men are above the single partner threshold above the overall average NUMBER NUMBER acts partners threshold above the overall median NUMBER NUMBER acts partners above the overall mode NUMBER acts partners and here women have a higher mode NUMBER and median NUMBER number of partners so in this contrived population females are more promiscuous than males unless promiscuity is defined uselessly gordon

ham,this article from URL has been sent to you by khare URL sure does explain fork not yet abandoned rohit khare URL some friends indeed do more harm than good september NUMBER NUMBER by mary duenwald friends are supposed to be good for you in recent years scientific research has suggested that people who have strong friendships experience less stress they recover more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live longer than the friendless they are even less susceptible to the common cold studies show but not all friends have such a salutary effect some lie insult and betray some are overly needy some give too much advice psychologists and sociologists are now calling attention to the negative health effects of bad friends friendship is often very painful said dr harriet lerner a psychologist and the author of the dance of connection in a close enduring friendship jealousy envy anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will rear their heads one has to decide whether the best thing is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this is bad for my health and i m disbanding it another book when friendship hurts by dr jan yager a sociologist at the university of connecticut at stamford advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside there s this myth that friendships should last a lifetime dr yager said but sometimes it s better that they end that social scientists would wait until now to spotlight the dangers of bad friends is understandable considering that they have only recently paid close attention to friendship at all marriage and family relationships between siblings or parents and children have been seen as more important of course troubled friendships are far less likely to lead to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are and children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go bad as a popular author of relationship advice books dr lerner said never once have i had anyone write and say my best friend hits me dr beverley fehr a professor of psychology at the university of winnipeg noted that sociological changes like a NUMBER percent divorce rate have added weight to the role of friends in emotional and physical health now that a marital relationship can t be counted on for stability the way it was in the past and because people are less likely to be living with or near extended family members people are shifting their focus to friendships as a way of building community and finding intimacy said dr fehr the author of friendship processes until the past couple of years the research on friendship focused on its health benefits now we re starting to look at it as a more full relationship said dr suzanna rose a professor of psychology at florida international university in miami like marriage friendship also has negative characteristics the research is in its infancy psychologists have not yet measured the ill effects of bad friendship dr fehr said so far they have only through surveys and interviews figured out that it is a significant problem the early research dr fehr added is showing that betrayal by a friend can be more devastating than experts had thought how can a friend be bad most obviously dr rose said by drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill advised pursuit when you think of people who were friends at enron she added you can see how friendship can support antisocial behavior betrayal also makes for a bad friendship when friends split up said dr keith e davis a professor of psychology at the university of south carolina it is often in cases where one has shared personal information or secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential another form of betrayal dr yager said is when a friend suddenly turns cold without ever explaining why it s more than just pulling away she said the silent treatment is actually malicious at least as devastating is an affair with the friend s romantic partner as recently happened to one of dr lerner s patients i would not encourage her to hang in there and work this one out dr lerner said a third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults the other person dr yager said one of the NUMBER people who responded to dr yager s most recent survey on friendship described how when she was NUMBER her best friend called her a derogatory name the woman now NUMBER was so devastated that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with people ever since dr yager said emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse but it is more insidious dr yager said some people constantly set up their friends she explained they ll have a party not invite the friend but make sure he or she finds out risk takers betrayers and abusers are the most extreme kinds of bad friends dr yager said but they are not the only ones she identifies NUMBER different varieties occupying the second tier of badness are the liar the person who is overly dependent the friend who never listens the person who meddles too much in a friend s life the competitor and the loner who prefers not to spend time with friends most common is the promise breaker this includes everyone from the person who says let s have a cup of coffee but something always comes up at the last minute to someone who promises to be there for you when you need them but then isn t dr yager said some friendships go bad as some romantic relationships do when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons to dislike the other one with couples it can take NUMBER to NUMBER months for someone to discover there s something important they don t like about the other person said dr rose of florida international one might find for example that in subtle ways the other person is a racist in friendships which are less intense it may take even more time for one person to meet the other s dislike criteria whether a friendship is worth saving dr lerner said depends on how large the injury is sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let something go she added it s also an act of maturity sometimes to accept another person s limitations acceptance should come easier among friends than among spouses dr lerner said because people have more than one friend and do not need a full range of emotional support from each one but if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the friendship is causing undue stress the healthy response is to pull away dr yager said to stop sharing the personal or intimate details of life and start being too busy to get together ever it takes two people to start and maintain a friendship but only one to end it dr yager said friendship because it is voluntary and unregulated is far easier to dissolve than marriage but it is also comparatively fragile experts say ideally the loss of a bad friendship should leave a person with more time and appreciation for good ones dr lerner said it is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have them in order while you re healthy and your life and work are going well she said because when a crisis hits when someone you love dies or you lose your job and your health insurance when the universe gives you a crash course in vulnerability you will discover how crucial and life preserving good friendship is URL how to advertise for information

ham, URL september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER a m the wages of september NUMBER there is no going back september NUMBER changed our world those who deny such a watershed event take a superficially short term view and seem to think all is as before simply because the sun still rises and sets this is a colossal misjudgment the collapse of the towers the crashing into the pentagon and the murder of NUMBER NUMBER americans all seen live in real time by millions the world over tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds which if and when they heal will leave ugly scars for decades the killers dealt in icons the choice of NUMBER as the date of death targeting the manifest symbols of global capitalism and american military power and centering their destruction on the largest jewish city in the world yes they got their symbols in spades but they have no idea that their killing has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant but static morally repugnant and the worst plague upon the arab world since the crusades by lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth the vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and bombs but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after NUMBER NUMBER they prove only ghoulish not fearsome the more the world knows of al qaeda and bin laden the more it has found them both vile and yet banal and so is confident and eager to eradicate them and all they stand for it is one thing to kill innocents quite another to take on the armed might of an aroused united states easily dodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of afghanistan may make good theater and bring about braggadocio dealing with grim american and british commandos who have come NUMBER NUMBER miles for your head prompts abject flight and an occasional cheap infomercial on the run and the ultimate consequence of the attacks of september NUMBER will not merely be the destruction of al qaeda but also the complete repudiation of the taliban the iranian mullocracy the plague of the pakistani madrassas and any other would be fundamentalist paradise on earth foreign relations will not be the same in our generation our coalition with europe we learn was not a partnership but more mere alphabetic nomenclature and the mutual back scratching of euro american globetrotters a paper alliance without a mission nearly NUMBER years after the end of the cold war the truth is that europe out of noble purposes for a decade has insidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an antidemocratic eu a NUMBER NUMBER person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power is as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often dubious international accords this sad realization september NUMBER brutally exposed and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the moment completely lost its moral bearings indeed as the months progressed the problems inherent in the european way became all too apparent pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness abstract moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility and constant american ankle biting even as europe lives in a make believe shire while we keep back the forces of mordor from its picturesque borders with only a few brave frodos and bilbos tagging along nothing has proved more sobering to americans than the skepticism of these blinkered european hobbits after september NUMBER america learned that moderate arab countries are as dangerous as hostile islamic nations after september NUMBER being a saudi egyptian or kuwaiti means nothing special to an american at least not proof of being any more friendly or hostile than having libyan syrian or lebanese citizenship indeed our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of their anticommunism oil and arms purchases like nato belongs to a pre NUMBER NUMBER age of soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies now we learn that broadcasting state sponsored hatred of israel and the united states is just as deadly to our interests as scud missiles and as likely to come from friends as enemies worst case scenarios like iran and afghanistan offer more long term hope than stable regimes like the saudis governments that hate us have populations that like us and vice versa the saudi royal family whom NUMBER NUMBER american troops protect and the mubarak autocracy which has snagged billions of american dollars are as afraid of democratic reformers as they are islamic fundamentalists and with good reason islamic governments in iran and under the taliban were as hated by the masses as arab secular reformers in exile in the west are praised and championed the post NUMBER NUMBER domestic calculus is just as confusing generals and the military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of iraq chicken hawks and worse yet such traditional vietnam era invective i think rings hollow after september NUMBER and sounds more like mcclellan s shrillness against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery ended than resonant of patton s audacity in charging after murderous nazis more americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of vietnam nearly NUMBER years ago indeed most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of vietnam are now in or nearing retirement and thank god there is no generation of americans in the present military other than a few thousand brave veterans of the gulf mogadishu and panama who have been in sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties because american soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security is lax in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in lower manhattan fly regularly on a jumbo jet or handle mail at the pentagon or cia than be at sea on a sub or destroyer real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than rejecting force inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad as our women children aged and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at home it seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into harm s way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect thousands in high rises politics have been turned upside down in the old days cynical conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes repellent realpolitik in the age of russian expansionism they were loathe to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist trojan horse whose belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians thus they were so often at loggerheads with naïve and idealist leftists no longer the end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive soviet communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy champions of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise open economics loot their treasuries and keep out the russians instead even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in the middle east than are dour and skeptical leftists the latter if multiculturalists often believe that democracy is a value neutral western construct not necessarily a universal good if pacifists they claim nonintervention not justice as their first priority the right not the left now is the greater proponent of global freedom liberation and idealism with obvious domestic ramifications for any republican president astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support all this and more are the wages of the disaster of september NUMBER and the subsequent terrible year and yet it is likely that for good or evil we will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead 
ham, begin pgp signed message hash shaNUMBER say amen somebody what the wsj said appended below the wtc as constructed was a confiscatory government boondoggle expropriated from the original pre construction property owners at the behest of a third generation trust fund aristocrat for the good of the city and owned by an authority looking for something else to do after it and its coach hounds in organized labor and organized crime had killed what was the largest port in the world s richest nation now of course it s about to get worse the sins of NUMBER years ago have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally irrational fanatics first those in religion and now those in government as a result a large part of NUMBER million square feet of once perfectly usable office space devoted at least ostensibly to commerce will be granted away in a potlatch that only government and special interest communities or stakeholders or whatever the cryptosocialist psycho rabble call themselves this week can organize to such perfection all this in probably the only city in the country that was founded by a business explicitly for the purpose of commerce not religious fanaticism not colonial expansion in a monarch s name commerce if they really wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites who collapsed those buildings using probably the only sharp objects on a plane full of government disarmed passengers the so called authority should disband itself and sell its property off to the highest bidder and let the market the cure to all luddism foreign and domestic government and superstitious decide if the new private owner wants to sell or give away a space for a memorial fine they could sell tickets and donate the money to the families of the dead and injured probably great for marketing the property at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the event and of course if the new owner wants to build something twice as tall or with twice as much space than the original NUMBER million square feet splendid whatever the market will bear in these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans national geodesic internetworks of strong financial cryptography and of exponentially decreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries economics and freedom can and will prevail over both superstition and statism it s probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower manhattan mega real estate to prevail this early in the game but it s going to happen sooner or later and whenever it does that will be a fitting memorial to those who died at the world trade center cheers rah URL the wall street journal september NUMBER NUMBER review outlook a living memorial as we write these words we can look down from our offices into the six story crater where the twin towers once stood like everyone else we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who died a year ago but we also think the best memorial to those who perished would be a living one the site of the world trade center calls forth many emotions especially today anger grief and respect for the many acts of heroism that took place there but underlying it all is the memory of the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were attacked and was a large reason they were targeted the best expression of the spirit of new york and of those who died would be to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries working meeting shopping eating that is engaged in the sort of productive work and play that used to take place there osama bin laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery but restoring this memory is not what the discussion in new york has been about so far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous rebuilding of downtown manhattan which lost NUMBER NUMBER jobs when the trade center fell instead the discussion centers on the size and scale of the memorial and on satisfying every political interest now clamoring for a piece of the action new york s political leadership and its financial and media elites are squandering a historic chance to rebuild a better more prosperous city this is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out what to do with the site in consultation with new york governor george pataki who is thinking primarily about his own november re election the commission made the decision to focus first on the memorial the manhattan institute s steve malanga argues that the commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space for the memorial getting on with the rebuilding and then returning to the memorial this is in essence what the pentagon has so successfully done rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for an outdoor memorial a design for which has yet to be decided a big part of the problem in new york is that the city s anti development activists know an opening when they see one they want the world trade center site and even some surrounding areas transformed into an enormous park these political advocates have had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in new york into a nightmare of delay and litigation and the world trade center site is now getting the same treatment worse they are cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own anti development agenda in the name of honoring the dead one family group even called a press conference to reject as disrespectful a proposed train line under the site we are not experts in designing war memorials but we re confident that a gigantic park in the heart of the world s financial center isn t the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago the great cities of europe and japan devastated in world war ii have all rebuilt and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban life perhaps the most powerful is found in rotterdam the dutch port city reduced to rubble by german bombing where survivors erected a statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be in this country the practice has been for the names of war dead to be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were affiliated if you walk into nassau hall at princeton university you ll find the names of NUMBER alumni who died in the revolutionary war the war of NUMBER the civil war the spanish american war world war i world war ii korea and southeast asia no one thinks it disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on around the walls containing their names in new york now it would help if political leaders looked beyond the emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city s future rudolph giuliani now that he s out office wants the entire NUMBER acres devoted to the memorial governor pataki has called for no structures on the footprints which being in the center of the site would severely curtail options mayor michael bloomberg initially raised his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the press and has since ducked for cover maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past maybe those responsible for the world trade center

ham, URL dear garrison there are at least six plans about what to do with ground zero in new york i believe a suitable memorial surrounded by a lovely park with benches walkways children s playgrounds possibly some concessions such as a restaurant small theater and a place for art works would be the best tribute to those who lost their lives what do you think should done with the space joe adams hillsdale new jersey i dread the thought of a big memorial in manhattan that s designed by committee and that s gone through public hearings and so forth it s going to be cold and ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more public space that the public hates of which there are plenty already new york is a bustling commercial city and that s the beauty of it it s a city of young ambitious dreamy people like the folks who died in the towers and it s not a memorializing city historic events occurred in new york that in any other city would be commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and historical museums and in new york there s barely a little plaque that s a great thing in my estimation it s a hustling city full of immigrants looking for their big chance and compared to that spirit of entrepreneurship a memorial plaza with a fountain and a statue of something seems dead to me look at grant s tomb who walks past it and thinks about president grant nobody people sit in the plaza by grant s tomb and think about lunch about sex about money about all the things that new york is about if you want to find grant read his memoirs his monument seems odd in new york it belongs in washington which is our memorial city new york is for the young and lively

ham,gn entanglements now on his orders u s forces are engaged around the globe in a war he did not expect in a world completely changed in the oval office last week cbs news correspondent scott pelley asked the president about iraq about whether americans are safe at home and about osama bin laden scott pelley you must be frustrated maybe angry after a year we still don t have osama bin laden president bush how do you know that i don t know whether osama bin laden is dead or alive i don t know that he s not leading a lot of parades and he s not nearly the hero that a lot of people thought he was this is much bigger than one person anyway this is we re slowly but surely dismantling and disrupting the al qaeda network that that hates america and we will stay on task until we complete the task i always knew this was a different kind of war scott see in the old days you measure the size and the strength of the enemy by counting his tanks or his airplanes and his ships this is an international manhunt we re after these people one at the time they re killers period pelley but have you won the war before you find osama bin laden dead or alive mr bush if he were dead there s somebody else to replace him and we would find that person but slowly but surely we will dismantle the al qaeda network and those who sponsor them and those who harbor them and at the same time hopefully lay the seeds for the conditions necessary so that people don t feel like they ve got to conduct terror to achieve objectives pelley do you look back on the afghan campaign with any doubts certainly we ve overthrown the taliban government certainly al qaeda has been scattered but some of the taliban leaders appear to have gotten away and there have been many civilian casualties as well mr bush uh huh well you know i am sad that civilians lost their life but i understand war we did everything we can to everything we could to protect people when civilians did die it was because of a mistake certainly not because of intention we liberated a country for which i m extremely proud no i don t second guess things it s things never go perfect in a time of war pelley are you committed to ending the rule of saddam hussein mr bush i m committed to regime change pelley there are those who have been vocal in their advice against war in iraq some of our allies in the gulf war saudi arabia turkey for example even your father s former national security advisor mr scowcroft has written about it in the paper what is it in your estimation that they don t understand about the iraq question that you do appreciate mr bush the policy of the government is regime change scott hasn t changed i get all kinds of advice i m listening to the advice i appreciate the consultations and we ll consult with a lot of people but our policy hasn t changed pelley on air force one you described the terrorists as evil mr bush yeah pelley i don t think anyone would disagree with that but at the same time many in the arab world are angry at the united states for political reasons because of our policy in israel or our troops in the oil region of the middle east is there any change in foreign policy that you re considering that might reduce arab anger against the united states mr bush hmm well i m working for peace in the middle east i m the first president that ever went to the united nations and publicly declared the need to have a palestinian state living side by side with israel in peace i ve made it clear that in order for there to be peace the palestinians have gotta to get some leadership that renounces terror and believes in peaces and quits using the palestinian people as pawns i ve also made it clear to the other arab nations in the region that they ve got responsibilities if you want peace they gotta work toward it we re more than willing to work for it but they have to work for it as well but all this business isn t going to happen as long as a few are willing to blow up the hopes of many so we all gotta work to fight off terror pelley arafat has to go mr bush either he s he s been a complete failure as far as i am concerned utter disappointment pelley there has been some concern over the year about civil liberties mr bush yeah pelley in fact an appeals court recently was harsh about your administration s decision to close certain deportation hearings they said quote a government operating in secrecy stands in opposition to the constitution where do you draw the line sir mr bush i draw the line at the constitution we will protect america but we will do so on within the guidelines of the constitution confines of the constitution spirit of the constitution pelley is there anything that the justice department has brought to you as an idea that you ve thought no that s too far i don t wanna go mr bush nah not that that i remember and i am pleased with the justice department i think that attorney general s doing a fine job by the way and to the extent that our courts are willing to make sure that they review decisions we make i think that s fine i mean that s good it s healthy it s part of america pelley franklin roosevelt said that america should stand in defense of four freedoms freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom from want and freedom from fear do we have that today mr president freedom from fear mr bush i think more than we did in retrospect the fact that we are on alert the fact that we understand the new circumstances makes us more free from fear than on that fateful day of september the NUMBERth we ve got more work to do pelley and americans should not live their lives in fear mr bush i don t think so no i think americans oughta know their government s doing everything possible to help and obviously if we get information that relates directly a particular attack we ll deal with it and if we get noise that deals with a general attack we ll alert people there are a lot of good folks working hard to disrupt and deny and run down leads and the american people need to go about their lives it seems like they are

ham,an old indian friend forwarded this to me a while ago URL slaughter in the name of god by salman rushdie friday march NUMBER NUMBER page aNUMBER washington post the defining image of the week for me is of a small child s burned and blackened arm its tiny fingers curled into a fist protruding from the remains of a human bonfire in ahmadabad gujarat in india the murder of children is something of an indian specialty the routine daily killings of unwanted girl babies the massacre of innocents in nellie assam in the NUMBERs when village turned against neighboring village the massacre of sikh children in delhi during the horrifying reprisal murders that followed indira gandhi s assassination they bear witness to our particular gift always most dazzlingly in evidence at times of religious unrest for dousing our children in kerosene and setting them alight or cutting their throats or smothering them or just clubbing them to death with a good strong length of wood i say our because i write as an indian man born and bred who loves india deeply and knows that what one of us does today any of us is potentially capable of doing tomorrow if i take pride in india s strengths then india s sins must be mine as well do i sound angry good ashamed and disgusted i certainly hope so because as india undergoes its worst bout of hindu muslim bloodletting in more than a decade many people have not been sounding anything like angry ashamed or disgusted enough police chiefs have been excusing their men s unwillingness to defend the citizens of india without regard to religion by saying that these men have feelings too and are subject to the same sentiments as the nation in general meanwhile india s political masters have been tut tutting and offering the usual soothing lies about the situation being brought under control it has escaped nobody s notice that the ruling party the bharatiya janata party bjp or indian people s party and the hindu extremists of the vishwa hindu parishad vhp or world hindu council are sister organizations and offshoots of the same parent body even some international commentators such as britain s independent newspaper urge us to beware excess pessimism the horrible truth about communal slaughter in india is that we re used to it it happens every so often then it dies down that s how life is folks most of the time india is the world s largest secular democracy and if once in a while it lets off a little crazy religious steam we mustn t let that distort the picture of course there are political explanations ever since december NUMBER when a vhp mob demolished a NUMBER year old muslim mosque in ayodhya which they claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god ram hindu fanatics have been looking for this fight the pity of it is that some muslims were ready to give it to them their murderous attack on the train load of vhp activists at godhra with its awful atavistic echoes of the killings of hindus and muslims by the train load during the partition riots of NUMBER played right into the hindu extremists hands the vhp has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and insufficient radicalism of india s bjp government prime minister atal bihari vajpayee is more moderate than his party he also heads a coalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the bjp s more extreme hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together but it isn t working anymore in state elections across the country the bjp is being trounced this may have been the last straw for the vhp firebrands why put up with the government s betrayal of their fascistic agenda when that betrayal doesn t even result in electoral success the electoral failure of the bjp is thus in all probability the spark that lit the fire the vhp is determined to build a hindu temple on the site of the demolished ayodhya mosque that s where the godhra dead were coming from and there are reprehensibly idiotically tragically muslims in india equally determined to resist them vajpayee has insisted that the slow indian courts must decide the rights and wrongs of the ayodhya issue the vhp is no longer prepared to wait the distinguished indian writer mahasveta devi in a letter to india s president k r narayanan blames the gujarat government led by a bjp hard liner as well as the central government for doing too little too late she pins the blame firmly on the motivated well planned out and provocative actions of the hindu nationalists but another writer the nobel laureate v s naipaul speaking in india just a week before the violence erupted denounced india s muslims en masse and praised the nationalist movement the murderers of godhra must indeed be denounced and mahasveta devi in her letter demands stern legal action against them but the vhp is determined to destroy that secular democracy in which india takes such public pride and which it does so little to protect and by supporting them naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces the nobel award the political discourse matters and explains a good deal but there s something beneath it something we don t want to look in the face namely that in india as elsewhere in our darkening world religion is the poison in the blood where religion intervenes mere innocence is no excuse yet we go on skating around this issue speaking of religion in the fashionable language of respect what is there to respect in any of this or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around the world in religion s dreaded name how well

ham, all else being equal the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of air density air density drops off pretty quickly and i really should be doing something other than digging up the math for that i think it involves calculus to integrate the amount of mass as the column of the atmosphere trails off chemistry types have a method for dealing with this question without dragging in the calculus suppose an atmosphere to be mainly affected by gravity resulting in the potential energy for a mass m to be linear in height h mgh what relative concentrations will we have when two different packets of air are in equilibrium if they are at the same height we will have half the mass in one and half the mass in the other and the amount flowing from one to the other balances the amount flowing in the opposite direction NUMBER if they are at differing heights then a greater percentage of the higher air tends to descend than that percentage of the lower air which ascends in order for the two flows to balance the higher packet must contain less air than the lower and the mass balance of the flows corresponds thusly high percentage of thin air low percentage of dense air now rates are exponential in energy differences NUMBER so that theoretically we should expect an exponential decay in height to compensate how does it go in practice dave NUMBER how well does it balance chemical equilibria seem stable as they deal with very large numbers over a very long time economic equilibria are viewed from the mayfly standpoint of individual people and so at best the shot noise is very visible NUMBER that is to say rates will be exponential in the free energy differences between endpoints and a transition state we can ignore that complication in this model

to get their way yeah sure dave whatever you need to believe the truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and improving rss in general each with their own brand of attitude to be

really quite pitiful when normal people don t understand something they usually try learning about it they read up ask questions and seek the help of those that understand it this before shooting

being too much trouble and blogs it expects others to do research for him abuses anyone who tries to help him pontificates incorrectly about only part of the issue realizes he s been a fool but

rejected of course at the same time dave tries to play the sympathy card what utter fucking nonsense this past weekend the blogosphere excoriates him for his blame america bullshit then the rss

class teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel with the rapid growth in popularity of web meetings the rationale for this world class relationship stems from the growing need for

information with team members between meetings rather than depending on intermittent insecure email and multiple copies of constantly changing documents inter meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium independent of time in asynchronous mode a team member can access read and edit information relevant to the meeting group at his her convenience rather than having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others a secured environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also essential endeavors magi technology converts the web into a secure platform for sharing information directly from people s desktops webex meetings can be recorded and reviewed at any time documents shared in the meeting can be actioned in real time or at a later date calendars

magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to web meeting participants not only can they share and access information at will but they can also know which other participants are

ham,maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our allies our requirements our technological advances and the strategic environment and build on stability provided by these alliances as well as with institutions such as asean and the asia pacific economic cooperation forum to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage change in this dynamic region we are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power competition several potential great powers are now in the midst of internal transition most importantly russia india and china in all three cases recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape with russia we are already building a new strategic relationship based on a central reality of the twenty first century the united states and russia are no longer strategic adversaries the moscow treaty on strategic reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a critical change in russian thinking that promises to lead to productive long term relations with the euro atlantic community and the united states russia s top leaders have a realistic assessment of their country s current weakness and the policies internal and external needed to reverse those weaknesses they understand increasingly that cold war approaches do not serve their national interests and that russian and american strategic interests overlap in many areas united states policy seeks to use this turn in russian thinking to refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and challenges we are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the global war on terrorism we are facilitating russia s entry into the world trade organization without lowering standards for accession to promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations we have created the nato russia council with the goal of deepening security cooperation among russia our european allies and ourselves we will continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the former soviet union in the belief that a prosperous and stable neighborhood will reinforce russia s growing commitment to integration into the euro atlantic community at the same time we are realistic about the differences that still divide us from russia and about the time and effort it will take to build an enduring strategic partnership lingering distrust of our motives and policies by key russian elites slows improvement in our relations russia s uneven commitment to the basic values of free market democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remain matters of great concern russia s very weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation nevertheless those opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years or even decades the united states has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral relationship with india based on a conviction that u s interests require a strong relationship with india we are the two largest democracies committed to political freedom protected by representative government india is moving toward greater economic freedom as well we have a common interest in the free flow of commerce including through the vital sea lanes of the indian ocean finally we share an interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable asia differences remain including over the development of india s nuclear and missile programs and the pace of india s economic reforms but while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about india today we start with a view of india as a growing world power with which we have common strategic interests through a strong partnership with india we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future the united states relationship with china is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable peaceful and prosperous asia pacific region we welcome the emergence of a strong peaceful and prosperous china the democratic development of china is crucial to that future yet a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the communist legacy china s leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state in pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the asia pacific region china is following an outdated path that in the end will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness in time china will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that greatness the united states seeks a constructive relationship with a changing china we already cooperate well where our interests overlap including the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the korean peninsula likewise we have coordinated on the future of afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter terrorism and similar transitional concerns shared health and environmental threats such as the spread of hiv aids challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens addressing these transnational threats will challenge china to become more open with information promote the development of civil society and enhance individual human rights china has begun to take the road to political openness permitting many personal freedoms and conducting village level elections yet remains strongly committed to national one party rule by the communist party to make that nation truly accountable to its citizen s needs and aspirations however much work remains to be done only by allowing the chinese people to think assemble and worship freely can china reach its full potential our important trade relationship will benefit from china s entry into the world trade organization which will create more export opportunities and ultimately more jobs for american farmers workers and companies china is our fourth largest trading partner with over NUMBER billion in annual two way trade the power of market principles and the wto s requirements for transparency and accountability will advance openness and the rule of law in china to help establish basic protections for commerce and for citizens there are however other areas in which we have profound disagreements our commitment to the self defense of taiwan under the taiwan relations act is one human rights is another we expect china to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments we will work to narrow differences where they exist but not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree the events of september NUMBER NUMBER fundamentally changed the context for relations between the united states and other main centers of global power and opened vast new opportunities with our long standing allies in europe and asia and with leaders in russia india and china we must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships become routine and unproductive every agency of the united states government shares the challenge we can build fruitful habits of consultation quiet argument sober analysis and common action in the long term these are the practices that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open the path of progress ix transform america s national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty first century terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity they did not touch its source america is successful because of the hard work creativity and enterprise of our people president bush washington d c joint session of congress september NUMBER NUMBER the major institutions of american national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements all of them must be transformed it is time to reaffirm the essential role of american military strength we must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge our military s highest priority is to defend the united states to do so effectively our military must assure our allies and friends dissuade future military competition deter threats against u s interests allies and friends and decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails the unparalleled strength of the united states armed forces and their forward presence have maintained the peace in some of the world s most strategically vital regions however the threats and enemies we must confront have changed and so must our forces a military structured to deter massive cold war era armies must be transformed to focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might occur we will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational challenges the presence of american forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the u s commitments to allies and friends through our willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others the united states demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of power that favors freedom to contend with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face the united states will require bases and stations within and beyond western europe and northeast asia as well as temporary access arrangements for the long distance deployment of u s forces before the war in afghanistan that area was low on the list of major planning contingencies yet in a very short time we had to operate across the length and breadth of that remote nation using every branch of the armed forces we must prepare for more such deployments by developing assets such as advanced remote sensing long range precision strike capabilities and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces this broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the ability to defend the homeland conduct information operations ensure u s access to distant theaters and protect critical u s infrastructure and assets in outer space innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new approaches to warfare strengthening joint operations exploiting u s intelligence advantages and taking full advantage of science and technology we must also transform the way the department of defense is run especially in financial management and recruitment and retention finally while maintaining near term readiness and the ability to fight the war on terrorism the goal must be to provide the president with a wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of coercion against the united states our allies and our friends we know from history that deterrence can fail and we know from experience that some enemies cannot be deterred the united states must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy whether a state or non state actor to impose its will on the united states our allies or our friends we will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations and to defend freedom our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build up in hopes of surpassing or equaling the power of the united states intelligence and how we use it is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states designed around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive fixed object the soviet bloc the intelligence community is coping with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of targets we must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to keep pace with the nature of these threats intelligence must be appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems and coordinated with our allies and friends we need to protect the capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the knowledge of how best to surprise us those who would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and to maximize injury we must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security since the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted inside the united states we must also ensure the proper fusion of information between intelligence and law enforcement initiatives in this area will include strengthening the authority of the director of central intelligence to lead the development and actions of the nation s foreign intelligence capabilities establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing the nation and our allies continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to sustain our intelligence advantage investing in future capabilities while working to protect them through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence capabilities and collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the government with all source analysis as the united states government relies on the armed forces to defend america s interests it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations we will ensure that the department of state receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of american diplomacy the state department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with other governments and in this new era its people and institutions must be able to interact equally adroitly with non governmental organizations and international institutions officials trained mainly in international politics must also extend their reach to understand complex issues of domestic governance around the world including public health education law enforcement the judiciary and public diplomacy our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations civil wars and other humanitarian catastrophes as humanitarian relief requirements are better understood we must also be able to help build police forces court systems and legal codes local and provincial government institutions and electoral systems effective international cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals backed by american readiness to play our part just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out to others we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to public information efforts that can help people around the world learn about and understand america the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where america must excel we will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect americans are not impaired by the potential for investigations inquiry or prosecution by the international criminal court icc whose jurisdiction does not extend to americans and which we do not accept we will work together with other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and cooperation through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral agreements that will protect u s nationals from the icc we will implement fully the american servicemembers protection act whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of u s personnel and officials we will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the right level and allocation of government spending on national security the united states government must strengthen its defenses to win this war at home our most important priority is to protect the homeland for the american people today the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing in a globalized world events beyond america s borders have a greater impact inside them our society must be open to people ideas and goods from across the globe the characteristics we most cherish our freedom our cities our systems of movement and modern life are vulnerable to terrorism this vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the september eleventh attacks as time passes individuals may gain access to means of destruction that until now could be wielded only by armies fleets and squadrons this is a new condition of life we will adjust to it and thrive in spite of it in exercising our leadership we will respect the values judgment and interests of our friends and partners still we will be prepared to act apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require when we disagree on particulars we will explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives we will not allow such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together with our allies and our friends our shared fundamental interests and values ultimately the foundation of american strength is at home it is in the skills of our people the dynamism of our economy and the resilience of our institutions a diverse modern society has inherent ambitious entrepreneurial energy our strength comes from what we do with that energy that is where our national security begins

strategically stable asia differences remain including over the development of india s nuclear and missile programs and the pace of india s economic reforms but while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about india today we start with a view of india as a growing world power with which we have common strategic interests through a strong partnership with india we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future the united states relationship with china is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable peaceful and prosperous asia pacific region we welcome the emergence of a strong peaceful and prosperous china the democratic development of china is crucial to that future yet a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the communist legacy china s leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state in pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the asia pacific region china is following an outdated path that in the end will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness in time china will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that greatness the united states seeks a constructive relationship with a changing china we already cooperate well where our interests overlap including the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the korean peninsula likewise we have coordinated on the future of afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter terrorism and similar transitional concerns shared health and environmental threats such as the spread of hiv aids challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens addressing these transnational threats will challenge china to become more open with information promote the development of civil society and enhance individual human rights china has begun to take the road to political openness permitting many personal freedoms and conducting village level elections yet remains strongly committed to national one party rule by the communist party to make that nation truly accountable to its citizen s needs and aspirations however much work remains to be done only by allowing the chinese people to think assemble and worship freely can china reach its full potential our important trade relationship will benefit from china s entry into the world trade organization which will create more export opportunities and ultimately more jobs for american farmers workers and companies china is our fourth largest trading partner with over NUMBER billion in annual two way trade the power of market principles and the wto s requirements for transparency and accountability will advance openness and the rule of law in china to help establish basic protections for commerce and for citizens there are however other areas in which we have profound disagreements our commitment to the self defense of taiwan under the taiwan relations act is one human rights is another we expect china to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments we will work to narrow differences where they exist but not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree the events of september NUMBER NUMBER fundamentally changed the context for relations between the united states and other main centers of global power and opened vast new opportunities with our long standing allies in europe and asia and with leaders in russia india and china we must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships become routine and unproductive every agency of the united states government shares the challenge we can build fruitful habits of consultation quiet argument sober analysis and common action in the long term these are the practices that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open the path of progress ix transform america s national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty first century terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity they did not touch its source america is successful because of the hard work creativity and enterprise of our people president bush washington d c joint session of congress september NUMBER NUMBER the major institutions of american national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements all of them must be transformed it is time to reaffirm the essential role of american military strength we must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge our military s highest priority is to defend the united states to do so effectively our military must assure our allies and friends dissuade future military competition deter threats against u s interests allies and friends and decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails the unparalleled strength of the united states armed forces and their forward presence have maintained the peace in some of the world s most strategically vital regions however the threats and enemies we must confront have changed and so must our forces a military structured to deter massive cold war era armies must be transformed to focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might occur we will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational challenges the presence of american forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the u s commitments to allies and friends through our willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others the united states demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of power that favors freedom to contend with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face the united states will require bases and stations within and beyond western europe and northeast asia as well as temporary access arrangements for the long distance deployment of u s forces before the war in afghanistan that area was low on the list of major planning contingencies yet in a very short time we had to operate across the length and breadth of that remote nation using every branch of the armed forces we must prepare for more such deployments by developing assets such as advanced remote sensing long range precision strike capabilities and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces this broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the ability to defend the homeland conduct information operations ensure u s access to distant theaters and protect critical u s infrastructure and assets in outer space innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new approaches to warfare strengthening joint operations exploiting u s intelligence advantages and taking full advantage of science and technology we must also transform the way the department of defense is run especially in financial management and recruitment and retention finally while maintaining near term readiness and the ability to fight the war on terrorism the goal must be to provide the president with a wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of coercion against the united states our allies and our friends we know from history that deterrence can fail and we know from experience that some enemies cannot be deterred the united states must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy whether a state or non state actor to impose its will on the united states our allies or our friends we will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations and to defend freedom our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build up in hopes of surpassing or equaling the power of the united states intelligence and how we use it is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states designed around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive fixed object the soviet bloc the intelligence community is coping with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of targets we must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to keep pace with the nature of these threats intelligence must be appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems and coordinated with our allies and friends we need to protect the capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the knowledge of how best to surprise us those who would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and to maximize injury we must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security since the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted inside the united states we must also ensure the proper fusion of information between intelligence and law enforcement initiatives in this area will include strengthening the authority of the director of central intelligence to lead the development and actions of the nation s foreign intelligence capabilities establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing the nation and our allies continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to sustain our intelligence advantage investing in future capabilities while working to protect them through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence capabilities and collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the government with all source analysis as the united states government relies on the armed forces to defend america s interests it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations we will ensure that the department of state receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of american diplomacy the state department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with other governments and in this new era its people and institutions must be able to interact equally adroitly with non governmental organizations and international institutions officials trained mainly in international politics must also extend their reach to understand complex issues of domestic governance around the world including public health education law enforcement the judiciary and public diplomacy our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations civil wars and other humanitarian catastrophes as humanitarian relief requirements are better understood we must also be able to help build police forces court systems and legal codes local and provincial government institutions and electoral systems effective international cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals backed by american readiness to play our part just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out to others we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to public information efforts that can help people around the world learn about and understand america the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where america must excel we will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect americans are not impaired by the potential for investigations inquiry or prosecution by the international criminal court icc whose jurisdiction does not extend to americans and which we do not accept we will work together with other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and cooperation through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral agreements that will protect u s nationals from the icc we will implement fully the american servicemembers protection act whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of u s personnel and officials we will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the right level and allocation of government spending on national security the united states government must strengthen its defenses to win this war at home our most important priority is to protect the homeland for the american people today the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing in a globalized world events beyond america s borders have a greater impact inside them our society must be open to people ideas and goods from across the globe the characteristics we most cherish our freedom our cities our systems of movement and modern life are vulnerable to terrorism this vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the september eleventh attacks as time passes individuals may gain access to means of destruction that until now could be wielded only by armies fleets and squadrons this is a new condition of life we will adjust to it and thrive in spite of it in exercising our leadership we will respect the values judgment and interests of our friends and partners still we will be prepared to act apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require when we disagree on particulars we will explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives we will not allow such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together with our allies and our friends our shared fundamental interests and values ultimately the foundation of american strength is at home it is in the skills of our people the dynamism of our economy and the resilience of our institutions a diverse modern society has inherent ambitious entrepreneurial energy our strength comes from what we do with that energy that is where our national security begins

makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere the intensity of the microwave emissions their brightness varies according to

NUMBER of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons found a remarkable level of agreement between the two to verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units christy compared temperature readings recorded by radiosonde thermometers to temperatures reported by

agreed to within NUMBER NUMBER degrees celsius about NUMBER NUMBER fahrenheit per decade the same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions the idea was to

radiosonde launch sites globally if they were evenly distributed around the world that would equal approximately one for every NUMBER NUMBER square miles of the earth s surface water temperatures which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures come from thermometers on piers and buoys and aboard ships of opportunity the ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool

NUMBER years a new system of approximately NUMBER deep ocean buoys has been established gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data instrument accuracy msu with nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years a method was devised to merge all the data into a single consistent time series each satellite has its own bias that if not calculated and removed would introduce spurious trends the biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years and were sufficient to determine these biases because the msu instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations the biases between the satellites are known to within NUMBER

measurements as stated above and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate instrument accuracy ground based thermometers of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings since most thermometers for which long term records exist are in towns and cities the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads parking lots runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of

get on the forbes NUMBER is to have no college at all can you say bootstraps boys and girls i knew you could sure discussion in forbes rigorous research that especially when the data in their own list contradicts them i continue to look at the list and all the inherited growed entries i guess if i read it enough times my vision will clear given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school like say mine is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a government run high school you ll probably get more of those on the forbes NUMBER as well as time goes on if we ever get around to having a good old fashioned government collapsing transfer payment depression an economic version of this summer s government forest conflagration caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clear cutting enough forests did out west this summer that should motivate more than a few erst slackers out there including me to learn to actually feed themselves the next category on the forbes

smart not rich don t take my word for it ask their admissions office look at the admissions stats over the years for proof i at on point looked into stanford business school after learning that tuition was NUMBERk no financial aid was available and part time work was disallowed this smart person decided that i was not willing to spend the NUMBER application fee non refundable during attendance at my local business school i was told repeatedly i should have gone for it to quote a prof northwestern mba it has nothing to do with the education you receive in general european and canadian business schools are better and more innovative its the connections he used the words american nobility meritocracy american style was invented at the ivy league after world war ii even stanford got the hint and of course chicago taught them all how right practically nobody who goes to a top NUMBER american institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days unless of course their parents who couldn t afford to go there themselves got terminal degrees in the last NUMBER years or so and their kids still had to get the grades and biased by intelligence test scores to get in invented being the right word dubya went to yale and hbs i guess practically gets you around that problem the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with terminal degrees until they actually own something and hire people or learn to make something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis persist in the practically insane belief like life after death that economics is some kind of zero sum game that dumb people who don t work hard for it make all the money and if someone is smart works hard and is rich then they stole their wealth somehow btw none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame me for the fact that i m using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders you were apparently too dumb to grab the right end i went to missouri and i don t have a degree in anything actually useful much less a terminal one which means i m broker than anyone on this list it s just that you of all people lots with educations far surpassing my own should just plain know better the facts speak for themselves if you just open your eyes and look there are no epicycles the universe does not orbit the earth and economics is not a zero sum game the cost of anything including ignorance and destitution is the forgone alternative in this case intelligence and effort i will however admit to being educated waay past my level of competence and by the way you discuss economics so have you apparently its interesting but in this part of the world nova scotia a recent study found that college graduates earn less than graduates of NUMBER year community colleges trade schools they did decline to mention that the demand for some trades is so great that some of them are demanding university degrees to get in just for the record the average salary for a university graduate including advanced degree holders here is c NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER us no wonder half of san francisco has set up here we have a whole whack of call centers that have arrived here in the last couple of years i think they hire some entry level it people for around NUMBER NUMBER us an hour which of course fits perfectly for me my entry level job in NUMBER paid NUMBER NUMBER an hour the fundamental difference is that most of the jobs that require a trade are unionized in other words in this part of the world for the vast majority of people union dues are a better investment than tuition the counter argument to this is that many college graduates leave for better work elsewhere but the counter counter argument is that we are the thin edge one of several really prison labor in the us would be another of third world wages and work practices coming to north america i worked at a company that had a NUMBER year wage freeze the fact that they could maintain that and prosper just says volumes about the economy in this part of the world i met many people there like me who felt that was fine i can vote with my feet they didn t quite realize that just about every large employer in the area has similar or worse policies anyway eventually they started a union drive during the vote retired employees were brought in by the employer rumours were that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here a bottle of rum and somehow allowed to vote the union filed a grievance which was denied by a minister of labour who hey guess what used to be a vp at the company that s free labor markets at work the business continues to prosper as i was told when i was there it is a cash cow as long as the joa joint operating agreement with the competing paper is in place and if you think that any of those wonderful american companies out of some free enterprise belief in competing for the best talent are going to do anything about that sorry most of them received generous subsidies in return i m sure for an understanding about the labor markets here btw if we ever actually had free markets in this country including the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes all those smart people in the forbes NUMBER would have more money and there would be more self made people on that list in addition most of the people who inherited money on the list would have much less of it not even relatively speaking finally practically all of that new money would have come from economic efficiency and not stolen from someone else investment bubbles or not that efficiency is called progress for those of you in the people s republics of berkeley or cambridge it means more and better stuff cheaper over time a terrible petit bourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite or you d know about it by now in economic terms it s also called an increase in general welfare and no virginia i m not talking about extorting money from someone who works and giving it to someone who doesn t in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as santa claus come election time much as i like to accept what you say i do believe in free markets i have difficulty finding any except of course for labor markets which governments go to great lengths to protect well unless the supply is tight it was a great run with the technology industry producing most of the self made billionaires on the list but now we ve got a government sponsored monopoly and the concept of more stuff cheaper which it has always promised seems to be disappearing a particularly galling example is high speed internet access an article i read a couple of years ago that it is an area where the pricing approaches of the it industry cheaper better or you die and the telecom industry maintain your monopoly through regulation and get guaranteed price increases through the same regulators meet sadly to say the telecom industry seems to have won the whole entertainment industry riaa palladium thing seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer seems less important than using regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to produce profits for the favored few in short then economics is not a zero sum game property is not theft the rich don t get rich off the backs of the poor and redistributionist labor theory of value happy horseshit is just that horseshit happy or otherwise to believe otherwise is quite literally given the time marx wrote capital and the manifesto romantic nonsense i usually agree but when there s a republican in office i feel like they re the biggest believers in the manifesto in reverse create a reserve pool of labor reduce the rights of that proletariat you ve just created with bogus law and order policies concentrate capital in the hands of a few ideally people who can get you reelected and the economy will take care of itself oh and lie use the word compassionate a lot i guess i tend to believe that a certain amount of poverty reduction actually helps a modern capitalist state the basic economic tenet of the republic party seems to be the more homeless under each overpass the more efficient the rest of us will be and the facts are for most people in the western world are declining standards of living declining benefits disappearing social safety net greater working hours essentially since the entrance of women into the work force not blaming women in any way they have a right to work but its now NUMBER wage earners in each family and still declining standards of living is the reality again to quote that wonderfully liberal document i keep

ham,i ve seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forums for several years i ve always found archaeology interesting for no particular reason here is a recent article from u s news that i actually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository james rogers jamesr URL URL defrosting the past ancient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers a bounty of a warming world by alex markels as he hiked near colorado s continental divide in the summer of NUMBER ed knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at NUMBER NUMBER feet it looked like a bison skull the building contractor and amateur archaeologist recalls i thought that s strange bison don t live this high up knapp brought the skull to the denver museum of nature and science where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a bison one that died about NUMBER years ago this was an extraordinary discovery says russ graham the museum s chief curator adding that it could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago there s probably a lot more like it yet to be found and not just bison colorado isn t the only place where glaciers and snowfields are melting decades of unusual warmth in regions from peru to alaska a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and industry have shrunk or thawed many of the world s NUMBER NUMBER glaciers as the ice recedes a treasure trove of human and animal artifacts is emerging extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze the fabrics wood bone and dna rich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists understanding of our predecessors health habits and technology and the prey they pursued it s mind boggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains says johan reinhard a high altitude archaeologist and explorer in residence at the national geographic society rare spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the andes of peru in the NUMBERs and the legendary NUMBER NUMBER year old ice man found at the edge of a receding glacier in the alps in NUMBER have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information now as the ice continues to retreat it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains vanishing act the trick is finding such specimens before mother nature and looters take them first once uncovered frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals moreover they re often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them don t even realize they re ancient that was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in british columbia canada three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal it looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice recalls warren ward a teacher from nearby nelson but when i looked closer i could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones figuring they had found the remains of another hunter or perhaps a fur trapper the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a zip loc bag and delivered them to local officials archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunter s body along with a woven hat fur clothing and what seemed to be a medicine bag carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about NUMBER years ago dubbed kwaday dan ts inchi or long ago person found by people of the champagne and aishihik first nations who may be his direct descendants he is perhaps the best preserved human from the period ever found in north america other findings from melting ice in the neighboring yukon region could explain what that long ago person was doing in the mountains in the first place before this there was no archaeological record of people living here says greg hare a yukon government archaeologist now we see that this area was very much part of people s seasonal activities like ward s discovery the search began by chance when kristin benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband gerry kuzyk hunted sheep at NUMBER NUMBER feet in the mountains of the south yukon they followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung it was really odd because i knew there hadn t been caribou in the area for at least NUMBER years recalls kuzyk then a wildlife biologist with the yukon government caribou cake returning a week later he found what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it it turned out to be a NUMBER NUMBER year old atlatl or spear thrower further investigation of the ice patch and scores of others around the region revealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling NUMBER NUMBER years of changing hunting practices scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies hunters followed the game they returned for centuries and discarded some equipment in the ice we ve got people hunting with throwing darts up until NUMBER NUMBER years ago says hare who now oversees the research project then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about NUMBER NUMBER years ago and by NUMBER NUMBER years ago there s no more throwing darts now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck they are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in alaska s wrangell and st elias mountain ranges the united states most glaciated terrain and in the andes johan reinhard thinks the fast thawing european alps could also deliver more findings perhaps as exquisite as the ice man global warming is providing us high altitude archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now we re probably about the only ones happy about it

showed that people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso but because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold a tax on espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol burbank estimates the tax could generate NUMBER million to NUMBER million a year city council aides dispute his figures saying their research shows the tax would bring in NUMBER NUMBER million to NUMBER million a year burbank s institute is funded by foundations and labor unions the think tank s mission is to promote public policy in the interests of low income people and it has long

organized as jolt joined to oppose the latte tax among the members are seattle s chamber of commerce and the city s two largest coffee franchises starbucks and tully s the tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that contains espresso a task that could be an administrative nightmare for smaller cafes especially during the frantic morning rush if espresso counts come under suspicion coffeehouse owners could face a city audit university of chicago economics professor michael greenstone said the tax doesn t add up the purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable and this is neither he said on the efficiency side it s surely going to lead to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to avoid the tax for example starbucks could claim that they are using finely ground coffee instead of coffee run though an espresso maker and that consequently they are exempt from the tax would they be right i don t know but finding out will surely take lots of legal fees that could have gone to child care of course from a public relations perspective this is an ingenious idea and i mean that in a cynical way they ve pitted espresso drinkers against child care supporters and who s going to side with the espresso drinkers in fact the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political two step where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public stance of political correctness in a liberal city like seattle corporations continually advertise their commitment to social activism and throughout the debate over the initiative jolt members prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care starbucks will continue to support early learning and childhood development programs through the millions of dollars we contribute annually the company said however starbucks does not understand why the economic opportunity institute would recommend an additional consumer tax on espresso beverages or any other single consumer product the city council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before voters next year the initiative s authors say it is directed at vendors critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through higher prices effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee the tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of espresso including decaf drip coffee would be exempt burbank says the tax would reach only a pre selected group of consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip so he s been pitching it as a modern day robin hood tax where the needy get a dime

ham,good idea this could also be a job for pNUMBERp lots of people would love to devote their spare cycles bandwidth and unblocked ip addresses to giving the chinese unfettered net access in a sense this is what the peek a booty project does URL but let s play out the next few moves good guys google enables ssl access bad guys chinese government again blocks all access to google domains good guys set up google proxies on ever changing set of hosts peek a booty bad guys ban ssl or any unlicensed opaque traffic at the national firewall good guys hide google traffic inside other innocuous looking activity bad guys require nationwide installation of client side netnannyish software good guys offer software which disables spoofs monitoring software bad guys imprison and harvest organs from people found using monitoring disabling software and on and on the best we can hope is that technological cleverness by raising the costs of oppression or by provoking intolerable oppression brings social liberalization sooner rather than later gordon original message from rohit khare khare alumni caltech edu to fork spamassassin taint org sent monday september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm subject how about subsidizing ssl access to google a cheeky letter to the editors of the economist follows along with the article i was commenting on rohit in your article about chinese attempts to censor google last week the search goes on sept NUMBERth the followup correctly noted that the most subversive aspect of google s service is not its card catalog which merely points surfers in the right direction but the entire library by maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire world wide web if you can get to google s cache you can read anything you d like the techniques chinese internet service providers are using to enforce these rules however all depend on the fact that traffic to and from google or indeed almost all public websites is unencrypted almost all web browsers however include support for secure sockets layer ssl encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like upgrading to ssl makes it effectively impossible for a man in the middle to meddle censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in china the only choice left is to either ban the entire site range of ip addresses but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in the article of course the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic costs real money if the united states is so concerned about the free flow of information why shouldn t the broadcasting board of governors sponsor an encrypted interface to google or for that matter the rest of the web to date public diplomacy efforts have focused on public sector programming for the voice of america radio sawa and the like just imagine if the us government got into the business of subsidizing secure access to private sector media instead nothing illustrates the freedom of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself and most of it is already salted away at google and the internet archive project on second thought i can hardly imagine this administration

print edition in chinese the nickname for google an american internet search engine is gougou meaning doggy for the country s fast growing population of internet users NUMBERm according to an official estimate it is proving an elusive creature earlier this month the chinese authorities blocked access to google from internet service providers in china apparently because the search engine helped chinese users to get access to forbidden sites now after an outcry from those users access has been restored an unusual climbdown by china s zealous internet censors hardly more sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to use google to search for material deemed offensive to the government access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by google as it trawls the internet these once provided a handy way for chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites after the blocking of google on august NUMBERst many chinese internet users posted messages on bulletin boards in china protesting against the move their anger was again aroused last week when some chinese internet providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked google site to far less powerful search engines in china duncan clark the head of a beijing based technology consultancy firm bda china ltd says china is trying a new tactic in its efforts to censor the internet until recently it had focused on blocking individual sites including all pages stored on them now it seems to be filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key words that might indicate undesirable content for example earlier this week when using eastnet a beijing based internet provider a search on google for falun gong a quasi buddhist exercise sect outlawed in china usually aborted before all the results had time to appear such a search also rendered google impossible to use for several minutes 
ham,anyone who doesn t appreciate both pluck and luck is only looking at part of the equation america has in fact moved hard toward meritocracy but and this is a huge one you don t necessarily find it on the forbes list there is an element of luck even if only being in the right place at the right time to go that high beyond the forbes list there are many ways in which almost pure luck is involved in significant wealth being a super model for example though i think most people would be surprised by a lot of super models cindy crawford was valedictorian of her high school most people of course aren t in those stratified realms it is the rest of us who tend to sort there is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of merit in the first place rawls claims merit doesn t exist sowell seems to agree at least in part but i m sure sowell would also state that the benefits of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous and if merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring iq purity of heart or the ability to satisfy customers functionally most people seem to equate merit with iq though they say it would be better if it were purity of heart yet the type of merit that lands you on the forbes list or even just being a garden variety millionaire next door is more likely to be the serving customers definition differences due to merit when they are perceived as such generate far more animosity than differences due to luck luck can be forgiven superior performance often not original message from fork admin URL mailto fork admin URL on behalf of geege schuman sent monday

NUMBER glaciers as the ice recedes a treasure trove of human and animal artifacts is emerging extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze the fabrics wood bone and dna rich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists understanding of our predecessors health habits and technology and the prey they pursued it s mind boggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains says johan reinhard a high altitude archaeologist and explorer in residence at the national geographic society rare spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the andes of peru in the NUMBERs and the legendary NUMBER NUMBER year old ice man found at the edge of a receding glacier in the alps in NUMBER have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information now as the ice continues to retreat it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains vanishing act the trick is finding such specimens before mother nature and looters take them first once uncovered frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals moreover they re often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them don t even realize they re ancient that was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in british columbia canada three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal it looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice recalls warren ward a teacher from nearby nelson but when i looked closer i could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones figuring they had found the remains of another hunter or perhaps a fur trapper the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a zip loc bag and delivered them to local officials archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunter s body along with a woven hat fur clothing and what seemed to be a medicine bag carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about NUMBER years ago dubbed kwaday dan ts inchi or long ago person found by people of the champagne and aishihik first nations who may be his direct descendants he is perhaps the best preserved human from the period ever found in north america other findings from melting ice in the neighboring yukon region could explain what that long ago person was doing in the mountains in the first place before this there was no archaeological record of people living here says greg hare a yukon government archaeologist now we see that this area was very much part of people s seasonal activities like ward s discovery the search began by chance when kristin benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband gerry kuzyk hunted sheep at NUMBER NUMBER feet in the mountains of the south yukon they followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung it was really odd because i knew there hadn t been caribou in the area for at least NUMBER years recalls kuzyk then a wildlife biologist with the yukon government caribou cake returning a week later he found what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it it turned out to be a NUMBER NUMBER year old atlatl or spear thrower further investigation of the ice patch and scores of others around the region revealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling NUMBER NUMBER years of changing hunting practices scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies hunters followed the

then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about NUMBER NUMBER years ago and by NUMBER NUMBER years ago there s no more throwing darts now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck they are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in alaska s wrangell and st elias mountain ranges the united states most glaciated terrain and in the andes johan reinhard thinks the fast thawing european alps could also deliver more findings perhaps as exquisite as the ice man global warming is providing us high altitude archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now we re probably about the only ones happy about

for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion how much of this was illegal as opposed to simply amoral remains to be seen unfortunately california s response confusion lawsuits and policy tweaks hasn t been sufficient more unfortunately even if the state suddenly did all the right things including a hard nosed program designed to free

takeover of the utilities tempting but a bad idea when there s genuine competition as we could achieve in electricity generation the private sector tends to do a better job instead of abandoning deregulation california should find a way to inject real competition into the market we do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization at least under current conditions smart regulation is essential but the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control there are two ways conservation and replacement we need more of both the

harder to disrupt electricity to homes and businesses this technology is coming along fast state policies are not keeping pace investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all california should be doing more to encourage this whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low income households california hasn t done badly on conservation in a general sense and energy customers did react to last year s soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back but it s lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether maybe this is all pointless the bush administration s energy policies so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil coal and nuclear are making us all more vulnerable never mind what might happen if the coming war in iraq

ham, i wanted to get back to this but didn t have the time i actually lived on a couple different indian reservations growing up in the pacific northwest and also spent a fair amount time in lakota sioux country as well and my parents have lived on an even more diverse range of indian reservations than i have my experience being a direct result of living with my parents i do get a lot of my information first hand or in some cases second hand from my father the income figures for the indians are somewhat misleading mostly because it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income while it is true that some indians live in genuine poverty it is typically as a consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe not something that was impressed upon them the primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity that exists separately from the individuals typically an indian corporation of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a single share the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from tribe to tribe in most tribes a dividend is paid out to each of the tribal members from the corporation usually to the tune of NUMBER NUMBERk per person depending on the tribe the dividend money comes from a number of places with the primary sources being the federal gov t and various businesses assets owned by the indian corporation you have to understand a couple things first a great many indian tribes are run as purely communist enterprises everyone gets a check for their share no matter what one of the biggest problems this has caused is very high unemployment often NUMBER NUMBER for tribal members who are more than happy take their dividend and not work the dividend they receive from the corporation often constitutes their sole income for government accounting purposes unfortunately to support this type of economics when no one works they ve had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those dividends many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works one of the ironies is that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white folk not indians second even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend they also receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the indian corporation to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually by benefits and perks we are talking about the kinds of things no other ordinary american receives from either their employer or the government it should be pointed out that while many of these indian corporations are ineptly run and mostly provide sinecures for other indians a minority are very smartly managed and a few hire non indian business executives with good credentials to run their business divisions an example of this is the haida corporation which while having less NUMBER NUMBER tribal shareholders has billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have gross revenues in the NUMBER NUMBER million range and growing yet the dividend paid out is strictly controlled about NUMBERk in this particular case and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to intelligent investment and use they don t eat their seed corn and have actually managed to grow their stash in contrast a couple islands over there is another tribe of NUMBER NUMBER people that has a net loss of about NUMBER million annually iirc while being regularly endowed by the federal government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets this particular tribe has a modest income in theory but the actual expenditures per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and many borrow money against future income incidentally in this particular case the people that are working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand dollars a year much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather than their own pockets somewhat annoying the federal government semi regularly grants valuable assets to these tribes when they ve burned through the ones previously given where feasible typically selling the assets to american or foreign companies and the cycle continues so what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems in a nutshell a thoroughly pathological culture and society few women reach the age of NUMBER without getting pregnant incest rape and gross promiscuity is rampant inbreeding heavy drug abuse during pregnancy and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded many of the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the earliest opportunity mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above on one reservation my parents lived the hiv infection rate was NUMBER many of these societies are thoroughly corrupt and the administration of the law is arbitrary and capricious they do have their own judges courts police etc in short many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a shambles because they have become the most pathological societies that i have ever seen anywhere because of their legal status there really aren t that many consequences for their behavior there are many things that i could tell you that i ve seen that you probably would not believe unless you d seen it yourself there are always good people in these tribes but it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good guys by a fair margin many times and this is a mobocracy typically btw if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are openly thugs try living on one of these messed up indian reservations it will give you an interesting perspective on things there are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous indians the first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely the second is where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part even if they maintain their tribal identity in both of these cases the tribal leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological cases mentioned above the indians are often quite wealthy technically and a lot of money is spent by the tribe per capita and the actual reportable income is quite high when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole it is just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income the poverty is social and cultural in nature not economic this was my original point on a tangent one thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi tribal corporate socialism many indian tribes implement a type of corporate socialism that is mind bogglingly bad in execution that they use this structure at all is an accident of history more than anything but what has interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well over the long run it is like a family corporation writ large it seems that in a future where familial ties will be increasingly voluntary the general concept may have some merit in general western society serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with the included dynamics but with an arbitrary set of self selecting individuals damn that was long and its late and it could have been a lot longer james rogers jamesr URL on NUMBER

ham,this article from URL has been sent to you by khare URL another reminder that the moral writ of intellectual property is and ought to be more limited than real property private money paid for these bits but expropriation may be fairer for ip than real p rohit khare URL vast detail on towers collapse may be sealed september NUMBER NUMBER by james glanz and eric lipton what is almost certainly the most sophisticated and complete understanding of exactly how and why the twin towers of the world trade center fell has been compiled as part of a largely secret proceeding in federal court in lower manhattan amassed during the initial stages of a complicated insurance lawsuit involving the trade center the confidential material contains data and expert analysis developed by some of the nation s most respected engineering minds it includes computer calculations that have produced a series of three dimensional images of the crumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit helping to identify the sequence of failures that led to the collapses an immense body of documentary evidence like maps of the debris piles rare photos and videos has also been accumulated in a collection that far outstrips what government analysts have been able to put together as they struggle to answer the scientifically complex and emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly failures of the buildings but everyone from structural engineers to relatives of victims fear that the closely held information which includes the analysis and the possible answers that families and engineers around the world have craved may remain buried in sealed files or even destroyed bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients the experts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they wait for the case to play out such restrictions are typical during the discovery phase of litigation and as it now stands the judge in the case who has agreed that certain material can remain secret for the time being has approved standard legal arrangements that should the lawsuit be settled before trial could cause crucial material generated by the competing sides to be withheld we re obviously in favor of releasing the information but we can t until we re told what to do said matthys levy an engineer and founding partner at weidlinger associates who is a consultant in the case and the author of why buildings fall down how structures fail norton NUMBERnd edition NUMBER let s just say we understand the mechanics of the whole process of the collapse mr levy said monica gabrielle who lost her husband richard when the south tower fell and who is a member of the skyscraper safety campaign said the information should be disclosed if they have answers and are not going to share them i would be devastated mrs gabrielle said they have a moral obligation the lawsuit that has generated the information involves larry a silverstein whose companies own a lease on the trade center property and a consortium of insurance companies mr silverstein maintains that each jetliner that hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist attack entitling him to some NUMBER billion rather than half that amount as the insurance companies say as both sides have prepared their arguments they have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert opinion about exactly what happened to the towers dean davison a spokesman for industrial risk insurers of hartford one of the insurance companies in the suit said of the findings there are some confidentiality agreements that are keeping those out of the public domain today he conceded that differing opinions among the more than NUMBER insurers on his side of the case could complicate any release of the material as for his own company whose consultants alone have produced more than NUMBER NUMBER pages of analysis and thousands of diagrams and photographs mr davison said every attempt would be made to give the material eventually to public authorities and investigative teams still some of that analysis relies on information like blueprints and building records from other sources like the port authority of new york and new jersey which built and owned the trade center and supports mr silverstein in the suit mr davison said he was uncertain how the differing origins of the material would influence his company s ability to release information in a statement the port authority said access to documents would be decided on a case by case basis consistent with applicable law and policy adding that it would cooperate with federal investigations the fate of the research is particularly critical to resolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into the buildings collapse that investigation led by the federal emergency management agency was plagued by few resources a lack of access to crucial information like building plans and infighting among experts and officials a new federal investigation intended to remedy those failings has just begun at the national institute of standards and technology or nist an agency that has studied many building disasters officials with nist have said it could take years to make final determinations and recommendations for other buildings a process they now acknowledge might be speeded up with access to the analysis done by the consultants on the lawsuit gerald mckelvey a spokesman for mr silverstein said of the real estate executive s own heavily financed investigative work we decline to comment other than to say that silverstein is cooperating fully with the nist investigation a spokesman for the agency confirmed it was in discussions with mr silverstein on the material but said no transfer had taken place with no shortage of money or expertise investigations by both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body of science and theory some of it relevant not only to the trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well the work should be available to other investigators said ramon gilsanz a structural engineer and managing partner at gilsanz murray steficek who was a member of the earlier inquiry it could be used to build better buildings in the future legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one governing the material can lead to a variety of outcomes from full or partial disclosure to destruction of such information in some cases litigants who paid for the reports may make them public themselves or they may ask to have them sealed forever it is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep some of those documents secret for one reason or another some legitimate some not said lee levine a first amendment lawyer at levine sullivan koch in washington mr levine said that because of the presumed value of the information the court might look favorably on requests to make it public but the uncertainty over the fate of the material is unnerving to many people especially experts who believe that only a complete review of the evidence not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect their own interests could lead to an advance in the federal investigation of the trade center it s important for this to get presented and published and subjected to some scrutiny said dr john osteraas director of civil engineering practice at exponent failure analysis in menlo park calif and a consultant on the case because then the general engineering community can sort it out the scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by any measure mr levy and his colleagues at weidlinger associates hired by silverstein properties have called upon powerful computer programs originally developed with the pentagon for classified research to create a model of the sept NUMBER attack from beginning to end the result is a compilation of three dimensional images of the severed exterior columns smashed floor and damaged core of the towers beginning with the impacts and proceeding up to the moments of collapse those images which mr levy is not allowed to release have helped pinpoint the structural failures the fema investigators did not have access to such computer modeling nor did the fema team have unfettered access to the trade center site with all its evidence in the weeks immediately after the attacks but no such constraints hampered engineers at lza thornton tomasetti brought to the site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of sept NUMBER daniel a cuoco the company president and a consultant to silverstein properties on the case said he had assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground zero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how the towers fell though the fema team could not determine where things actually fell mr cuoco said we ve indicated the specific locations mr cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details of the findings nor would mr osteraas discuss the details of computer calculations his company has done on the spread of fires in large buildings like the twin towers mr osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of photographs and videos of the towers that day some of which he believes have not been available to other investigators and the investigation has not limited itself to computers and documentary evidence for months experiments in wind tunnels in the united states and canada have been examining the aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed the weakening structures jack cermak president of cermak

ham,one of the most bizarre pages i ve seen on the web at first i thought it might be some sort of back story to a rpg but nope it looks like somebody believes this URL mNUMBER dinosaurs eggs and the origins of good and evil dinosaurs reptoid ets are reported to be NUMBER foot high crocodiles walking on their hind legs this is a description of a dinosaur it now appears in remote viewing that the reptoid ets dinosaurs and dragons are all linked together and that they all originated on earth the erideans who are reptoid derivatives have a home planet in the eridanus system like all other ets the reptoids have no reported home planet they also come over as entities with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit this is a description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see them thus it could be that the reptoids erideans nordics anunnaki but not the greys all have origins on earth and have a strong link to earth even if they choose to live elsewhere the greys do not appear to have a renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on earth the definitive work on dragons is the flight of dragons by peter dickinson if dragons did exist in the flesh they did not survive the long bow targets do not come much bigger truth is stranger than fiction thus the writer s current scenario is that there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard their eggs and young and who probably preferred to live underground they survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs NUMBER million years ago with difficulty they evolved into the erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet for them possibly with the help of another race of ets who wanted slaves but otherwise had no interest in earth or mind control thus it appears that the current reptoids are the spirits or ghosts of the dinosaurs they must have been powerful to survive NUMBER million years and also to appear to some people they have appeared to the writer in remote viewing they are living on as vampire entities such immortal minds are contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers if they can be encouraged to reincarnate then the power sources of the black magicians and mind controllers will disappear encouraging them to reincarnate will help so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great difficulty surviving reincarnation purging people s dinosaurs should remove all perverse psychic abilities not under their control they are a source of satanic guardian angels and demons they control us by owning our psi thus if we regain ownership of psi we must relinquish their control and that of all other mind controllers encourage people to regain ownership of their psi the origins of love hate and pure malice the following scenario appears to hold water and can account for the origins of our universal subconscious dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of rotting vegetation a good source of beetles and grubs for young hatchelings they did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm which made them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change in order to keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control to do this they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators this is an act of hatred and outward looking while a few dinosaurs did develop the ability to bear living young most did not the dinosaurs got in first and so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds they have become the source of all satans devils and demons birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep them warm a hen bird normally lays a series of eggs say one per day and only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid thus all eggs tend to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth this is primarily an act of love but inward looking bearing live young is not suitable to a bird of the air a pregnant pigeon would not fly very far antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm even if they are standing on ice mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act of love and inward looking this is especially true as a mammalian female can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird sitting on a nest dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young while birds and mammals developed love birds and mammals certainly do hate all enemies of their young but this is secondary if one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician then purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs unfortunately most of our religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control regardless of the front they put out to the public religion tends to concentrate on how to brainwash your neighbour conscious thought has built many mighty empires theologies and slave control systems out of using how to care for and protect one s young as a foundation thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something a load of dinosaur s eggs purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur s eggs of any entity tends to purge all malice back to its roots it looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings aided and abetted by various occultists and other as they will insist on vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the serenity of the writer he encourages them to reincarnate items for inspection for mind control to take place then someone must take control or ownership of the target s psi and pleasure centres check for the following nest of dinosaur s eggs holy dinosaurs etc eggs controllers or owners in peoples psi pleasure centres pain killing hormones abilities etc mind machines the original engraving or engram god and satan appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right t hey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams no doubt dinosaurs were the first job holders timetracks are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of time my our man s timetracks etc the time tracks of the universe universal subconscious galactic subconscious etc extinct races of ets can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices whenever one hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes suspect that the higher plane is a vampire one one may never know what they looked like or other basic characteristics which makes linking back a trifle difficult every extinct race etc blood ancestors are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via genetic linkages some of

their legs to keep it warm even if they are standing on ice mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act of love and inward looking this is especially true as a mammalian female can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird sitting on a nest dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young while birds and mammals developed love birds and mammals certainly do hate all enemies of their young but this is secondary if one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician then purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs unfortunately most of our religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control regardless of the front they put out to the public religion tends to concentrate on how to brainwash your neighbour conscious thought has built many mighty empires theologies and slave control systems out of using how to care for and protect one s young as a foundation thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something a load of dinosaur s eggs purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur s eggs of any entity tends to purge all malice back to its roots it looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings aided and abetted by various occultists and other as they will insist on vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the serenity of the writer he encourages them to reincarnate items for inspection for mind control to take place then someone must take control or ownership of the target s psi and pleasure

ham,russell turpin wrote gregory alan bolcer i m not sure since i haven t attended civics class in quite some time but the first amendment doesn t cover protected speech hate speech or actions the first two are wrong the first amendment does protect speech the supreme court decides it protects duh and that happens to include most of what people consider hate speech unlike many other nations the us has no laws against hate speech per se and the first amendment is the reason for that this was poking fun of the practice of making up differnt types of speech with different types of protected status i think the laws specialing out hate and protected speech are ridiculous the point i keep trying to make is that there s only two types speech and action i agree they are all speech and should be covered by the first amendment but if hate speech is so protected why are certain states trying to prosecute people for it there s only two answers and one of them is wrong NUMBER because hate speech is different and needs to have a different level of protection dictated by whoever s offended at the time NUMBER it s because it s not just speech but action a action who s consequences are foreseeable by any reasonable person hate speech is mislabeled it s really threat i think they let the mislabeling perpetuate as there s advantage in being able to counter threat with loss of liberty and money through civil and criminal lawsuits for people they don t like greg _________________________________________________________________ join the world s largest e mail service with msn hotmail URL

of analogies NUMBER efficiency seeks to minimize resources used NUMBER economy seeks to maximize benefit versus cost NUMBER elegance symbolizes good design NUMBER for the designer NUMBER for the user NUMBER the programming language as work environment NUMBER acquiring a sense of elegance NUMBER references the value of analogies programming language design is a comparatively new activity it has existed for less than half a century so it is often worthwhile to look to older design disciplines to understand better this new activity thus my book principles of programming languages design evaluation and implementation grew out of a study of teaching methods in architecture primarily but also of pedagogy in other disciplines such as aircraft design perhaps you have also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars fortran model t c dune buggy etc these analogies can be very informative and can serve as intuition pumps to enhance our creativity but they cannot be used uncritically because they are in the end just analogies ultimately our design decisions must be based on more than analogies since analogies can be misleading as well as informative in this essay i ll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design but i will base my remarks on a book about structural engineering the tower and the bridge by david p billington although there are many differences between bridges and programming languages we will find that many ideas and insights transfer rather directly according to billington there are three values common to many technological activities which we can call the three e s efficiency economy and elegance these values correspond to three dimensions of technology which billington calls the scientific social and symbolic dimensions the three s s we will consider each in turn efficiency seeks to minimize resources used in structural engineering efficiency deals with the amount of material used the basic criterion is safety and the issues are scientific strength of materials disposition of forces etc similarly in programming language design efficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources there are many examples where efficiency considerations influenced programming language design some are reviewed in my principles of programming languages in the early days the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing time although compile time resource utilization was also relevant in other cases the resource economized was programmer typing time and there are well known cases in which this compromised safety e g fortran s implicit declarations there are also many well known cases in which security i e safety was sacrificed for the sake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking e g array bounds checking efficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time but we must be careful that we are not comparing apples and oranges compile time is not interchangeable run time and neither one is the same as programmer time similarly computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are reduced to a common denominator such as money but this brings in economic considerations to which we now turn economy seeks to maximize benefit versus cost whereas efficiency is a scientific issue economy is a social issue in structural engineering economy seeks to maximize social benefit compared to its cost this is especially appropriate since structures like bridges are usually built at public expense for the benefit of the public in programming language design the public that must be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these programmers work economic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict for example the shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost of computer time compared to programmer time the shift from the second to the third generation involved the increasing cost of residual bugs in programs and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of program maintenance compared to program development other social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include whether major manufacturers support the language whether prestigious universities teach it whether it is approved in some way by influential organizations such as the us department of defense whether it has been standardized whether it comes to be perceived as a real language used by real programmers or as a toy language used by novices or dilettantes and so forth as can be seen from the historical remarks in my principles social factors are frequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming language often economic issues can be quantified in terms of money but the monetary values of costs and benefits are often unstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces also many social issues from dissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures are inaccurately represented by the single dimension of monetary cost all kinds of cost and benefit must be considered in seeking an economical design elegance symbolizes good design elegance who cares about elegance snorts the hard nosed engineer but billington shows clearly the critical role of elegance in hard nosed engineering for the designer it is well known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the difficulty of analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language see my principles for examples structural engineers face similar problems of analytic complexity but billington observes that the best designers don t make extensive use of computer models and calculation one reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete the engineer must make a decision about which variables are significant and which are not and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this decision is not made well also equations are often simplified e g made linear to make their analysis feasible and this is another potential source of error because of these limitations engineers that depend on mathematical analysis may overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis thus the price of safety is additional material and increased cost i e decreased efficiency and economy similarly in programming language design the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a choice between an under engineered design in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions and an over engineered design in which we have confidence but which is inefficient or uneconomical many people have seen the famous film of the collapse in NUMBER of the four month old tacoma narrows bridge it vibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design billington explains that this accident along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures was a consequence of an increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the NUMBERs however the very problem that destroyed the tacoma narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided by aesthetic principles according to billington the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis although they do not abandon it altogether rather their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance this is because solutions to structural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined that is there are many possible solutions to a particular problem such as bridging a particular river therefore expert designers restrict their attention to designs in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see the design looks unbalanced if the forces are unbalanced and the design looks stable if it is stable the general principle is that designs that look good will also be good and therefore the design process can be guided by aesthetics without extensive but incomplete mathematical analysis billington expresses this idea by inverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that in structural design function follows form he adds p NUMBER when the form is well chosen its analysis becomes astoundingly simple in other words the choice of form is open and free so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design i e efficient and economical design if we do so then we can let aesthetics guide design the same applies to programming language design by restricting our attention to designs in which the interaction of features is manifest in which good interactions look good and bad interactions look bad we can let our aesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design without having to check all the possible interactions for the user in this case what s good for the designer also is good for the user nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge that looks like it will collapse at any moment and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which features may explode if combined in the wrong way the manifest balance of forces in a well designed bridge gives us confidence when we cross it so also the manifestly good design of our programming language should reinforce our confidence when we program in it because we have well justified confidence in the consequences of our actions we accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade when the bridge is unable to sustain the load for which it was designed and collapses it won t much matter that it was beautiful on the outside so also in programming languages if the elegance is only superficial that is if it is not the manifestation of a deep coherence in the design then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their unwarranted confidence in summary good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good as a consequence these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense as can the users of the structures bridges or programming languages they design we may miss out on some good designs this way but they are of limited value unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs we may summarize the preceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my principles of programming languages the elegance principle confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good the programming language as work environment there are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well engineered programming language the programming language is something the professional programmer will live with even live in it should feel comfortable and safe like a well designed home or office in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that take place within it would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop a programming language should be a joy to use this will encourage its use and decrease the programmer s fatigue and frustration the programming language should not be a hindrance but should serve more as a collaborator encouraging programmers to do their jobs better as some automobiles are driving machines and work as a natural extension of the driver so a programming language should be a programming machine by encouraging the programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso the programming language should invite the programmer to design elegant efficient and economical programs through its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values for example in the variety of its features it may symbolize profligate excess sparing economy or asceticism the kind of its features may represent intellectual sophistication down to earth practicality or ignorant crudeness thus a programming language can promote a set of values by embodying certain values it encourages us to think about them by neglecting or negating other values it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention out of sight out of mind acquiring a sense of elegance aesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined sense of elegance necessary to good design billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive experience in design which especially in europe is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers because of it structural engineers design many more bridges than they build and they learn from each competition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers the public also critiques the competing designs and in this way becomes more educated their sense of elegance develops along with that of the designers so also to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages design obsessively and criticize revise and discard your designs you should also evaluate and criticize other people s designs and try to improve them in this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the real thing comes along references NUMBER billington david p the tower and the bridge the new art of structural engineering princeton

ham,why am i so passionate about decentralization because i believe some of today s most profound problems with networked applications are caused by centralization generically a centralized political or economic system permits only one answer to a question while decentralization permits many separate agents to hold different opinions of the same matter in the specific context of software centralized variables can only contain one valid value at a time that limits us to only representing information a according to the beliefs of a single agency and b that changes more slowly than it takes to propagate nevertheless centralization is the basis for today s most popular architectural style for developing network applications client server interaction using request response communication protocols i believe these are profound limitations which we are already encountering in practice spam for example is in the eye of the beholder yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the separate interests of senders and receivers slamming for another unfairly advantages the bidder with the lowest latency connection to a centralized auction server sharing ad hoc wireless networks is yet a third example of decentralized resource allocation furthermore as abstract as centralization induced failures might seem today these limits will _not_ improve as the cost of computing storage and communication bandwidth continue to plummet instead the speed of light and human independence constitute _fundamental_ limits to centralized information representation and hence centralized software architecture

washington the canadian government is considering a proposal that would force internet providers to rewire their networks for easy surveillance by police and spy agencies a discussion draft URL released sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every canadian with an internet account a plan that could sharply curtail the right to be anonymous online the canadian government including the department of justice URL and industry canada URL wrote the NUMBER page blueprint as a near final step in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to conduct electronic surveillance a proposed law based on the discussion draft is expected to be introduced in parliament late this year or in early NUMBER arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and combat even run of the mill crimes they also claim that by enacting these proposals canada will be following its obligations under the council of europe s cybercrime treaty URL which the country is in the process of considering if the discussion draft were to become law it would outlaw the possession of computer viruses authorize police to order internet providers to retain logs of all web browsing for up to six months and permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find hidden electronic and digital devices that a suspect might be concealing in most circumstances a court order would be required for government agents to conduct internet monitoring canada and the united states are nonvoting members of the council of europe and representatives from both countries police agencies have endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty URL which has drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups of nearly NUMBER participating nations only albania has formally adopted URL or ratified the treaty michael geist URL a professor at the university of ottawa who specializes in e commerce law says that the justification for adopting such sweeping changes to canadian law seems weak it seems to me that the main justification they ve given for all the changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to make changes geist said to me that s not a particularly convincing argument if there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority make that case geist added that there s nothing in the document that indicates new powers are needed i don t know that there have been a significant number of cases where police have run into problems probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is compelling internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data retention orders the united states has a similar requirement called the communications assistance for law enforcement act URL but it applies only to pre internet telecommunications companies it is proposed that all service providers wireless wireline and internet be required to ensure that their systems have the technical capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national security agencies according to the proposal companies would be responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment sarah andrews an analyst at the electronic privacy information center URL epic who specializes in international law says the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies their proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers not just internet providers andrews said the cybercrime treaty deals only with computer data epic opposes URL the cybercrime treaty saying it grants too much power to police and does not adequately respect privacy rights another section of the proposal says the canadian association of chiefs of police recommends the establishment of a national database with personal information about all canadian internet users the implementation of such a database would presuppose that service providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information the draft says gus hosein a visiting fellow at the london school of economics and an activist with privacy international calls the database a dumb idea immediately you have to wonder if you re allowed to use anonymous mobile phones or whether you re allowed to connect to the internet anonymously hosein said a representative for george radwanski URL canada s privacy commissioner said the office is reviewing the blueprint and does

ham,on wed NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER at NUMBER NUMBER frank bergmann wrote a more reasonable explication of the eu us differences according to some american journalist cited in a german magazine can someone help me is that the american public perceives the rest of the world basically as a thread against which you have to defend yourself using power this is not a correct assessment the american public couldn t care less however the us intelligence community correctly perceives a threat and it isn t the third world many european and other developed nations aggressively engage in covert operations against american interests its been going on for years and isn t even news things have stepped up in recent years and the us dod is none too pleased for better or worse the us is relatively good at that game too as with most backwater wars they are proxies for the interests of the big players find a current list of the top intelligence threats to the us you ll find that half the countries on that list are european most people are unaware of how aggressive these things have gotten in recent years on the other hand the europeans are used to the peace of their cozy post war system where external security is not an issue all security threads can be resolved by giving money to the threatening people and to integrate them into the wealthy sphere balkan palestinians bullshit the european governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition obviously some more than others us specops are often brought in to do dirty work inside europe for european governments usually with government advisors along for the mission i ve always wondered what the deal was such that we got involved at all the point being that we ve acted as assassins for european governments inside their borders against their own citizens under the auspices of those governments and in recent years not ancient history i know specop guys who left the military specifically because of the circumstances of some of these missions while they were posted for that duty i m certainly glad i was never assigned missions in that theater because there is a lot of covert nastiness going on in nominally friendly european democracies regardless giving money to people that threaten you has never created meaningful peace in the history of civilization we call it extortion under any other guise a lot of the current eu us issues can be explained by this difference of perception such as the current american unilateralism nobody wants to help us the american arrogance towards europe they don t want to do anything so why should we ask them and the growing rejection of the american policy in europe they want to abolish the law europe is looking increasingly like a basket case whatever problems the us is having these days europe looks worse and is going downhill faster why the us would want to emulate european behavior or the european way of doing things is beyond me the us asking for major policy advice from europe is like asking a quack for medical advice i really don t see what is wrong with unilateral anyway why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff i hope the incessant knee jerk conformist screeching that americans see coming from europe doesn t actually represent the views of europeans for various reasons i m not exactly a cheerleader for the us government but the premises of the argument against them here are lame my personal point is that few americans percentage of overall population have ever left their country while even german construction workers regularly spend their holidays in spain so i m not surprised that paranoia is growing i m betting you are underestimating the actual percentage the vast majority of people i know have lived worked and traveled outside the country at one time or another and i doubt europeans have traveled anywhere near as much in the western hemisphere as americans have despite the best efforts of france europe is still not the center of the universe i ll throw you a bone though most americans do consider europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it but from the perspective of an american how could you not look at it this way the impact of europe on america has diminished greatly over the years i love the smell of euro chauvinism in the morning first you assume that the north american continent is ethnically and culturally homogenous anybody that has actually traveled throughout north america knows this isn t true there are more than five major and very distinct cultures and societies in the us alone never mind the hundreds of diverse regional sub populations some of which are truly foreign apparently europeans confuse speaking the same language with having the same culture that would be like saying mexico is culturally identical to spain because they nominally speak the same language a wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with your average person living in san francisco despite speaking the same language and nominally living in the same country if i want to visit a wildly different culture for the holidays i ll go to oakland new orleans or similar they are far more different from where i live than some countries i ve traveled to and a lot of these places are farther from where i live than spain is from germany second the state i live in is the size of germany when i travel to a neighboring state which i do regularly how is this not equivalent in fact i probably travel much farther for the holidays than your german construction workers if you look at the eu as a single country only then does your analogy become comparable what kind of ridiculous superiority do europeans get from having relatively tiny countries in truth i find europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the us there are a lot of cultural similarities across the eu with relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very similar to the us the only real difference is that europeans have dozens of different languages which is hardly something i would call an advantage although there are a couple parts of the us where i can t understand a word they are saying either james rogers jamesr URL 
ham,ink that s a possibility i don t think it s nearly the possibility that s ascribed to it sometimes powell explained sometimes when we see very pointed political or parochial programming it gets attacked as unfair i see some of the same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when rush limbaugh exists they love diversity but somehow we should run howard stern off the planet if it has a point of view then it becomes accused of bias and then we have policies like here his tone went from ironic to sarcastic the fairness doctrine which seems to me like the antithesis of what i thought those people cared about so when somebody is pointed and opinionated we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic fairness and integrity or whatever to make them balance it out f c c world abounds in theories about michael powell one is that he can t make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries he regulates so he talks and talks and talks flamboyantly about the market in order to buy himself time another is that he s carrying water for the arbocks and the big cable companies another is that he is planning to run for the senate from virginia or to be appointed attorney general in a second bush term and doesn t want to do anything at the f c c that would diminish his chances another is that he s waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action so that he doesn t wind up going first and getting caught in the crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television networks in f c c world this is known as the powell doctrine of telecom after colin powell s idea that the united states should never commit itself militarily without a clear objective overwhelming force and an exit strategy and another is that he actually believes what he says and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural healthy and irreversible and more concentration would be just fine this is why elections matter reed hundt who isn t happy about what has become of his telecom act told me it s true that the f c c much more than say the war in afghanistan is a case in which a gore administration would be acting quite differently from the bush administration consumers might have noticed the difference by now but there s no question whether communications companies have noticed the arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would have done if gore had won next election they ll help the party that helped them if the republicans win policy will tilt further in the arbocks favor if they lose perhaps the arbocks rivals the long distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts with their friends now in power will stage a comeback america s present is not unrecognizably different from america s past gregory alan bolcer cto work NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER gbolcer at URL URL endeavors technology inc cell NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER 
ham, begin forwarded message from ian andrew bell hello URL date wed oct NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm us pacific to mike URL cc foib URL subject politicos re bowling for columbine opens this friday michael why is it that people who consider voting in an election an inconvenience would go to see a movie to show support for its message don t get me wrong i think this is the case people will go to see your movie as much to be entertained and informed as they will to express their malice and discontent towards not only the present regime in america but also the corrupt empty shallow pantomime which cast them into power in reality today the voting that takes place via the act of consumption far outweighs the impact caused by people going to a booth and dimpling the appropriate chad or some other such convoluted act of free democratic expression why because in america they believe in dollars dollars don t lie in practise they are the last frontier of truth in america universally accepted as expressions of fear desire passion and need compared to the swing of the almighty buck and jeb bush knows this a hanging chad has only the nethermost meaning given that fact i modestly propose an entirely new though wholly logical extension to the current democratic system in place in america i propose we augment and effectively replace the electoral system with a political stock market we should accept that politicians are entrepreneurs just like any other businessperson in america and embrace this fact in building an economic system which truly reflects their intent a politician should issue a constant number of shares dependent upon his tenure in government those shares should be traded on an open exchange say the g r e e d short of course for the global realists electoral exchange democratic politicians we believe in will see their stocks rise higher as faith in their ability to maintain office grows as the truth about their embezzling campaign funds for weekend trips to maui with their interns is revealed of course their fortunes will fall this represents an opportunity for the market forces those same forces which you intend to harness to express your own personal protest to voice their opinion on the quality of america s governance during the intervening four years between elections elections themselves will in effect become meaningless as they are now since their outcome will be influenced by the stock price of each and every congressman senator and presidential candidate just think of the coverage that could be given on msnbc strom thurman strom news quotes was down NUMBER today on fears that his latest heart operation will render him unable to attend senate armed services committee meetings until november this would provide rejuvenating content to the econo political news sector which has found post economic bubble coverage to be both tiresome and deoressing the establishment of this new stock exchange would of course create jobs for newly unemployed and governmentally retrained it systems engineers who could after passing the electoral securities exam become floor traders this would also allow for a convenient and very public method by which candidates could raise capital in the public markets to support their multi billion dollar campaigns the requirement for the support of legions of spin doctors permanent campaign managers and investor relations personnel would also create jobs perhaps even a new practice for ernst young arthur anderson et al insider trading scandals and misleading revenue declarations would of course catch martha stewart as an unwitting beneficiary thus spreading her influence to politics dividends if there are any on record at the close of a politician s career could be paid to current shareholders based on the holdings pensions funds could provide the institutional investment support necessary to underpin even the biggest dogs among the beltway set union funds brokerages and even pump and dump houses could benefit from meteoric rises in conservative candidates running in the southeast and the bush governmet would be allowed to place social security bets where they really mattered investors who lose their retirement life savings and support could rest assured that they were indeed robbed by crooks rather than poor investors although there s no way to protect any of these for worldcom like crashes ambitious inspired district attorneys could file criminal suits against candidates and campaign managers who underperform expectations thus assuring investors that their logic was not faulty instead they were merely defrauded by crooks and thieves on the whole i believe the system could work i could certainly work as well as our beloved securities trading

last thing the bushies want projected on the movie screens across america this week the film is first and foremost a devastating indictment of the violence that is done in our name for profit and power and no one in all the advance screenings i have attended has left the theatre with anything short of rage i truly believe this film has the potential to rock the nation and get people energized to do something this is not good news for junior and company not when they are trying to drag us into another war not when a crazed sniper is exercising his constitutional right to own a high powered

printing this is all because of you my crazy and loyal friends you made this happen against all the odds now i would like to ask you again to help me with my latest work bowling for columbine it s a movie that many critics have already called my best film to date they may be right it is certainly the most provocative thing i have ever done i have spent three years on it and i have to say it cuts deeper harder and funnier that anything i have given you so far the movie opens this friday in new york and los angeles and then in NUMBER more cities next week how it does in these first ten cities will determine whether or not the rest of the country gets to see it that is the nutty way our films are released if it doesn t have a big opening weekend you can kiss the film good bye therefore this weekend this film must be seen by millions of americans can you help me make that happen bowling for columbine is not a film simply about guns or school shootings that is only the starting point for my NUMBER hour journey into the dark soul of a country that is both victim and master of an enormous amount of violence both at home and around the world with this movie i have broadened my canvas to paint a portrait of our nation at the beginning of the NUMBERst century a nation that seems hell bent on killing first and asking questions later it is a movie about the state sponsored acts of violence and terrorism against our own poor and how we have created a culture of fear that is based on the racial dilemma we continue to ignore and it s a devastating comedy this film is going to upset some pretty big apple carts no film has ever said the things i am saying in bowling for columbine i expect to be attacked i expect certain theatres will not show it for fear of retribution i expect that this movie will be a bitter pill for many to swallow this is why i need your help movies live or die based on what happens at the box office the first weekend of its release i need you if you live in the new york or l a area to go see bowling for columbine this friday and saturday and take as many family members and friends with you as possible i guarantee you will not be disappointed and you may just see one of the best films of the year monday night in times square bowling for columbine had its premiere the crowd was amazing as it was this past saturday night at the chicago film festival the audience kept laughing or hooting or applauding so loud throughout the film that it was hard to hear the next line the hate mail the threats the promises of retribution have already started to roll in to the distributor of this movie united artists they are not backing down but how long will this last i need all of you in the new york tri state and southern california areas to go see bowling for columbine this weekend the rest of you can see it in a couple of weeks when it comes to your town a strong opening not only means that the rest of america will see this film it means that a good number of people who see it are going to leave the film angry enough to get active and get involved if it does poorly i will have a difficult time finding the funding for the movie i want to make next a film about NUMBER NUMBER and how bush is using that tragic day as a cover for his right wing agenda don t let that happen don t let the nra have one more success by stopping the wider distribution of this movie and together let us not remain silent in our opposition to bush s phony war against iraq if you live in new york you can see it at the lincoln plaza the sunshine and the loews NUMBERth st in l a you can catch it at the sunset NUMBER the westwood regent laemmle sunset laemmle towncenter encino landmark rialto pasadena and regal university irvine also please forward

ham,i have some patches that seem to fix avoid this problem now it is amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails long enough for ups s to run out and all that is left operational is the laptop and its battery supply first i put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was occurring so that if exmh is attempting for any reason to expand a sequence that isn t either a number or a range of numbers or a list of such things it will simply ignore the trash rather than giving a traceback this one solves the initial problem mh tcl was thu aug NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER mh tcl wed aug NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER set seq set rseq foreach range split string trim sequence if regexp NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER range just ignore anything bogus continue set parts split string trim range if llength parts NUMBER lappend seq parts that is amending proc mhseqexpand which is where the error was occurring before the code assumes that range is either nnn or nnn mmm so we should probably make sure that s true issue an error instead of just continue if you like but i don t think an error is needed but that just allowed me to create a similar problem in another place by typing nnn and rather than continue to fight fires like this i thought i should think more about brent s suggestion but rather than have the selection code actually validate the input which would mean it would have to know what is to be valid i decided that the right thing to do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input so i just stuck a catch around the msgshow that is processing the nonsense that the user has typed this way any later expansion to what msgshow treats as legal maybe allowing a sequence name like prev or next or anything else can be handled just there without someone needing to remember that they have to go fix the selection processing code to allow it but while i was playing there i noticed something i never new before if you type NUMBER the NUMBER changes to NUMBER and so on for each that is typed i suspect that s perhaps an artifact of is bound to a different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the current and the target folder but it has to mean something if the current input mode is a message number so let it mean but now i found it i think its nice but if we can type NUMBER why not NUMBER as well that kind of limitation bugs me so i fixed it and then i wondered about folders with names containing the special use of as the toggle character means there s no way to type those from the keyboard so i fixed that as well this makes two different restrictions there s no way to type a folder name that has a name beginning with but such a thing in mh would be a pain to use anyway so i doubt this will bother anyone and it is now only possible to toggle between typing the current target folder name when the name being typed is empty i m less happy about that part but i think i can live with it in order to allow folder names with s in them to exist and be typed then since i was there anyway i decided to do something about another feature that has always bugged me in normal keyboard mode s is the key used to show a message but if you ve just typed NUMBER and the ftoc is highlighting NUMBER as the current message and you want to now show that message you can t type s you have to type r instead so i fixed this one as well fixed here is in quotes as it assumes that the keybinding for msgshow is s if you change that to something else it will remain s in here i don t know enough tk tcl to have it discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order to bind the same one here r continues to work of course and now i got started in fixing irritants in this code i also made it clear the status line if you abort message folder entry mode c or g previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next message appeared which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had reverted to its usual bindings in any case what follows is the patch that does all of that i believe that if you apply this then the one above is probably not needed the catch around the msgshow will hide the problem i don t think we really need to fix brent s way of invoking it or include it anyway just for completeness i haven t run an exmh with the following patch but not the previous one so i don t know for sure that all will be ok then kre select tcl was thu aug NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER select tcl wed aug NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER

ham, hal devore said brent said in his book this paste function can be convenient but it turns out that users still need to keep track of the difference between the two selections if a user only understands the clipboard then the user of primary is only surprising i learned that it is best to have a separate paste user action for the two selections the convention is that buttonrelease NUMBER sets the insert point and inserts the primary selection the paste event e g the paste key simply inserts the clipboard selection at the current insert point yeah i learned by hearing exmh users scream in agony sorry about all that we should be able to clean this up if you grep for bind in seditbind you quickly find the text_selection proc i described in the previous email brent welch software architect panasas inc pioneering the world s most scalable and agile storage network URL welch URL _______________________________________________ exmh users mailing list exmh users URL URL 
ham, kevin oberman said it did for me but i am not willing to say it is not a tcl tk issue as other apps seemed to work ok for cut and paste and tk does its clipboard stuff a bit differently than most toolkits so i m not about to place blame just reporting my experience one more salvo on x and cut paste x specifies at least two mechanisms for cut paste but as usual mandates no policy windows and macintosh have a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy i m quite sure that tk implements all primary and clipboard selections accurately the primary selection is the one that is tied to the visible selection on your x display the clipboard selection is the one with the explicit copy step and is the same as what you have on windows and macintosh however exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism which is another archaic mechanism supported at one point perhaps still today by versions of emacs exmh has a policy that tries to unify all these mechanisms under one umbrella and by all reports it is not that great i would encourage folks to play with those NUMBER lines of code in text_selection and report what works well for them we may come up with NUMBER lines that work for everyone or perhaps introduce yet another setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models of course that s an admission of policy failure but i m willing to do that brent welch software architect panasas inc pioneering the world s most scalable and agile storage network URL welch URL _______________________________________________ exmh users mailing list exmh users URL URL 
ham, date sun NUMBER sep NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER from brent welch welch panasas com message id NUMBER baaNUMBER blackcomb panasas com i would encourage folks to play with those NUMBER lines of code in text_selection and report what works well for them we may come up with NUMBER lines that work for everyone or perhaps introduce yet another setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models of course that s an admission of policy failure but i m willing to do that i actually think you re looking in the wrong place i at least have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted or selected that stuff for me if perhaps not users of some gnome variant which appraently has been fixed anyway all seems to work just fine the problem is that a button NUMBER click clears the selection primary where it shouldn t the previous selection should only be cleared when there s something else to replace it even if the highlighting of what is selected is removed try this in any other ramdom application from xterm to netscape and see how it works there normally is no mouse based way to actually clear the primary selection that is set it to be a null string then because of the if i get asked for the selection value i will find something behaviour if you click intending to set the insert point the way most other gui s operate and then paste because the primary is clear but exmh still owns the selection because nothing else has taken it it does and finds some other ramdom stuff from either the clipboard or cut buffer which tends to be something that was deleted back in the ancient past and pastes that that behaviour to me anyway is the real issue once that gets fixed we can switch back to operating the normal select stuff click at new insert point paste mode of operation that almost everyone expects to work whether the select stuff is somewhere in one of the exmh windows or elsewhere kre ps this message is from my experience as a exmh user only i ve never really understood enough about x and selections to go gazing at that part of the code and see how it all really operates _______________________________________________ exmh users mailing list exmh users URL URL

ham,blogstart dublin something from the archives daev walsh forwards an article from the irish digest about billy in the bowl this story is also immortalised in an old dublin song which in turn was mentioned in a pogues track billy was a legless beggar in the alleys of stoneybatter and grangegorman where i now live during the NUMBERth century who discovered a new but not entirely legal way to make money blogend linktext billy in the bowl from daev hellshaw URL subject the case of the stoneybatter strangler a story of my new neighbourhood the irish digest july NUMBER the case of the stoneybatter strangler the handsome deformed billy in the bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors then one night he made the biggest mistake of his life dublin in the eighteenth century was noted for two things the architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes many of these beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin but there was one who campaigned among the working class this was billy in the bowl the strange appellation was derived from the fact that billy s sole means of transport was a large bowl shaped car with wheels seated in this bowl the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground with wooden plugs one in each hand billy s unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary as he had been born without legs nature however had compensated for this by endowing him with powerful arms and shoulders and what was most important an unusually handsome face this was billy s greatest asset in his daily routine of separating sympathetic passers by from their small change the cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century grangegorman and stoneybatter until a servant girl or an old lady would come along he would then put on is most attractive smile which together with his black curly hair never failed to halt the females the fact that such a handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity billy in the bowl however wasn t satisfied with becoming the daily owner of a generous number of small coins what his greed demanded were substantial sums of money the more he managed to get the more he could indulge in his pet vices gambling and drinking as a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers the first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold march evening as dusk was falling the victim was a middle aged woman who was passing through grangegorman lane on her way to visit friends in queen street on dublin s north quays when billy heard the woman s footsteps he hid behind some bushes in a ditch which skirted the lane as his unsuspecting victim drew close the beggar moaned and shouted and cried out for help trembling with excitement the woman dashed to the spot where billy lay concealed she bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch when two powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes in a few minutes it was all over the woman lay in a dead faint and billy was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his bowl his victirn s purse snug in his coat pocket an hour after the robbery the woman was found in a distracted condition but failed to give a description of her assailant and as billy in the bowl had figured nobody would suspect a deformed beggar again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan always shifting the place of attack to a different part of grangegorman or stoneybatter on one occasion billy in the bowl tried his tactics on a sturdy servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to strangle her the incident became known as the NUMBER grangegorman lane murder and caused a great stir hundred s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months billy in the bowl was forced to desert his usual haunts around this period dublin s first ever police force was been mobilised and the first case they were confronted with was the grangegorman lane murder months passed and billy in the bowl reverted once again to his old pasttime a number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and robbed and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a nightly patrol was placed on the district but the beggar still rolled along in his bowl pitied and unsuspected then came the night that finished billy s career of crime two stoudy built female cooks trudging back to their places of employment after a night out in the city were surprised and not a little shocked to hear shouts for help rushing over they came upon a huddled figure in the ditch billy thinking there was only one woman grabbed one of the cooks and tried to pull her into the ditch she proved much too strong for him however and while resisting tore at his face with her sharp finger nails meanwhile her companion acted with speed and daring pulling out her large hatpin she made for the beggar and plunged the pin into his right eye the screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the district and brought people dashing to the scene among them was a member of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning billy billy in the bowl was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence but they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl the grangegorman stoneybatter district became once again a quiet attractive dublin suburb where old ladies strolled and carefree servant girls laughed and giggled as they wended their way home at night daev _______________________________ rev dave daev walsh daev URL home URL weekly rant URL is it about a

ham,justin mason jm jmason org NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER well my point is more that we should aim our rescoring algorithm so that a spam hits NUMBER NUMBER any higher does us no good as it means an fp is a lot harder to recover from using compensation rules agreed but i have always thought that the value NUMBER was not the best value it should have been NUMBER i understand that initially only spammy scores were included but i believe the algorithm should be purely symmetrical and non spammy negative values should also have been balancing out the spammy positive values like they do in sa today then anything that was positive would be spam and anything negative would be non spam and i guess exactly zero is grey today s choice of NUMBER just adds an offset which i think cause people to assume things work differently than they do bob

ham,if you need to store a database password then clearly the first step is to store the text outside the web tree you can encrypt it and store the encryption key elsewhere so that at least an attacker has to get two different things also don t get full privileges create a user account that is granted very limited access however you can often do better than this if security is critical create a separate program which has these database keys as noted above and make the web program contact it create a very limited protocol that only lets you do the operations you need you can add specific operations later there s a performance hit which you re trading for improved data isolation giorgio zoppi wrote on fri aug NUMBER NUMBER david wheeler wrote the standard way to store passwords is not to store passwords instead store a salted hash of the password in a database when you get a purported password you re salt it compute the hash and determine if they are the same this is how unix has done it for years you want bigger hashes and salts than the old unix systems and you still want to prevent reading from those files to foil password crackers more info is in my book at URL well but this cannot be applied to database password which most web apps use the only solution i figure is store in clear outside web tree any other ideas feasible ciao giorgio never is forever deneb URL homepage URL david a wheeler dwheeler URL

ham, software vendors have been trying since forever to prevent software piracy remember when you had to enter a specific word from a specific page of the software manual which was printed on dark maroon paper so that it could not be photocopied didn t work propritery encoding of dvd s didn t work software that required the use of a registration key didn t work windows xp was shipped with this supposedly revolutionary method for stopping piracy and what happened how long was it before the code was cracked how many keygens are there for windows xp is someone running a pirated version of xp really going to use windows update to installed a service pack which breaks their os just because m didn t include the change in their readme fat chance my problem is not the same as ms s one i don t have to deal with millions of identical copy of the same cd with propably millions of working keys each download can be unique with a small preparation delay the key generator is a problem only if multiple keys are usable if the end users are teenagers you ll face a huge wall when asking to be NUMBER of the time online but if we think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients personnal information the end user will be willing to take every possible steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly i agree with all of you that mass production cds will not be safe from piracy in a near futur that can be seen as a collateral of mass market penetration btw thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight i m playing with gdb s dissassembler now but i don t think it s what a typical cracker would use any hints on unix cracking tools thanks yannick gingras coder for obb onside brainsick bract URL

ham, skip montanaro any thought to wrapping up your spam and ham test sets for inclusion w the spambayes project i gave it all the thought it deserved wink it would be wonderful to get several people cranking on the same test data and i m all in favor of that otoh my data subtree currently has more than NUMBER NUMBER files slobbering over NUMBER million bytes even if i had a place to put that much stuff i m not sure my isp would let me email it in one msg wink apart from that there was a mistake very early on whose outcome was that this isn t the data i hoped i was using i hoped i was using a snapshot of only recent msgs to match the snapshot this way of only spam from NUMBER but turns out they actually go back to the last millennium greg ward is currently capturing a stream coming into URL and i hope we can get a more modern and cleaner test set out of that but if that stream contains any private email it may not be ethically possible to make that available can you think of anyplace to get a large shareable ham sample apart from a public mailing list everyone s eager to share their spam but spam is so much alike in so many ways that s the easy half of the data collection problem

ham, tim another area for potentially fruitful study it s clear that the highest value indicators usually appear early in msgs and for spam there s an actual reason for that advertising has to strive to get your attention early so for example if we only bothered to tokenize the first NUMBER of a msg would results get worse neil schemenauer spammers could exploit this including a large mime part at the beginning of the message in pratice that would probably work fine note that URL s current tokenizer only looks at decoded text mime sections or raw message text if no mime exists spammers could put megabytes of other crap before that and it wouldn t even be looked at except that the email package has to parse non text parts well enough to skip over them and tokens for the most interesting parts of content type disposition transfer encoding decorations are generated for all mime sections schemes that remain ignorant of mime are vulnerable to spammers putting arbitrary amounts of nice text in the preamble area after the headers and before the first mime section which most mail readers don t display but which appear first in the file so are latched on to by graham s scoring scheme but i don t worry about clever spammers i ve seen no evidence that they exist NUMBER NUMBER wink even if they do the open source zoo is such that no particular scheme will gain dominance and there s no percentage for spammers in trying to fool just one scheme even if they did for the kind of scheme we re using here they can t know what nice text is not unless they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their messages to each different one at that point they d be doing targeted marketing and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously if you re out to make a quick buck you don t waste a second on hard targets ly y rs tim

ham,this is not directly spamassassin related but more of a general dealing with spam issue what is the best way to deal with spam during the smtp transaction there are domains and addresses that i know are spam at the mail from and can deal with at the smtp level i have been and i think most people respond with a NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER code a permanent error that pretty much means don t bother to try from that address again you ll get the same error people often add cathartic messages to accompany the NUMBER like spammers must die but this might not be the best way to go you are telling the spammers that you are on to them this may cause them to try other methods to get around your blocks is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail that is act like everything is ok during the smtp transaction but then just drop the mail into the bitbucket this is generally how spamassassin works since almost everyone uses it after the smtp transaction has completed successfully spammer thinks everything is going fine and has no reason to try new methods then there is a third possibility instead of returning a NUMBER code indicating you re on to the spammer fake a NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER response which is saying mailbox does not exist this would be in the hopes that some spammers out there actually remove names reported as non existent from their lists i know a slim hope but even if only a few do it can lower the incidence so what are the arguments for each do spammers even look at _any_ of the bounce messages they get the volume of bounces must be huge personally i m starting to think blackholes are the way to go but sending back that spammer die die die or stock access dee nied my ephasis added message can be pretty satisfying crist j clark cjclark URL cjclark URL URL cjc URL in remembrance URL _______________________________________________ spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk URL URL

ham,this is just an semi educated guess if i m wrong someone please correct me spamd setuid s to the user running spamc since you re calling spamc from a global procmailrc file it s being run as root most likely if called as root spamd won t open user_prefs files from the spamc man page u username this argument has been semi obsoleted to have spamd use per user config files run spamc as the user whose config files spamd should load if you re running spamc as some other user though eg root mail nobody cyrus etc then you can still use this flag the solution is to set dropprivs yes in etc procmailrc just before running spamc from the procmailrc man page dropprivs if set to yes procmail will drop all privileges it might have had suid or sgid this is only useful if you want to guarantee that the bottom half of the etc procmailrc file is executed on behalf of the recipient i hope that helps and i also hope it s right st original message from spamassassin talk admin URL mailto spamassassin talk admin URL on behalf of cheryl l southard sent tuesday september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm to spamassassin talk URL subject satalk user_prefs ignored hi all i am running spamassassin NUMBER NUMBER with procmail as my local delivery agent with sendmail i use spamc spamd so that it runs site wide from etc procmailrc spamd is run as root with the flags d a c and spamc isn t run with any flags when i was testing the program i deployed spamc from my personal procmailrc file my spamassassin user_prefs file was read each time i can see this because i have a non default required_hits value which gets reported in every e mail on the x spam status line now that i run spamc from the global etc procmailrc file my spamassassin user_prefs file is no longer being read or processed from e mails from outside computers the required_hits value gets set back to the one in etc mail spamassassin local cf however if i send local e mail my user_prefs file is read and processed correctly does anyone know how to fix this problem if this is a spamassassin or procmail bug thanks cheryl cheryl southard cld URL this URL email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven URL _______________________________________________ spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk URL URL this URL email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven URL _______________________________________________ spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk URL URL

ham, spamtalk said probably better than the spam phrases approach would be the database approach as currently used for white black listing any way to tie that to an xml retrieval from a list of central repositories does mysql do replication a properly done xml would let us eyeball the list as well as use it to keep the database up to date another idea could we synthesize an rbl so that URL becomes URL for a reverse lookup it is going to get tricky how to specify a randomized intermediate directory a good plan needs an implementation though URL hmm seems down to me basically it s a plan to store hash sums of urls phone numbers found in spam in a dnsbl for apps like spamassassin to look up a little like spamcop s spamvertized url list j this URL email is sponsored by dedicated servers only NUMBER linux or freebsd free setup fast network get your own server today at URL _______________________________________________ spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk URL URL

ham,gary funck gary intrepid com NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER in my experience there are spam messages that sneak past spam assassin that razor will pick up those are the ones that i m calling marginal basically i m hoping that the collective of razor users make a better judge of spam than any single program like sa can and therefore i can benefit from their judgement and get more extensive spam filtering i ve seen examples of this already where sa doesn t score the spam high enough to bounce it but razor does i think perhaps you missed the fact that sa scores are adjustable if you want sa to tag all messages listed in razor then you can put this in your spamassassin user_prefs file score razor_check NUMBER the default score is NUMBER and the default threshold needed is NUMBER therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by sa then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above NUMBER would be sufficient if you are already using sa then the above would be more efficient otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice once for sa and once again afterward if you really want to run razor individually then you should set the score razor_check NUMBER so that sa won t do it and avoid the double network hit however one of the benefits of using sa in combination with razor has been the history of false positive reports in the razor database the current score of NUMBER is hefty but not enough by itself to tag as spam but for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold razorNUMBER addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide of use as razorNUMBER bob

ham,i did something crudely along those lines for vms vax maybe NUMBER years ago there is at least one product that does it for pc though i don t recall its name it is also handy for cases where you have a cd image of some filesystem or some other image of a filesystem that is intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept or is not graceful readonly storage it is also more or less necessary if you want to work with worm file structures which are older still there have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the early NUMBERs if not before a generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement snapshots on top of an existing filesystem the written information must obviously be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you wrote to the storage a device level implementation is however perfectly adequate it does not of course distinguish for you what should have been changed and what should not if you truly know a device or perhaps a partition must not be written it can be simpler to either return error on writes or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data ntfs lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments i have not tried it on extfNUMBER or reiser btw think about your mention of raid and consider the complexity of writing to raidNUMBER or raidNUMBER i would contend that with cheaper storage these days it makes little sense to use raid save for shadowing and possibly striping those at least do not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher raid levels have and there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk may hold NUMBER gigs and up why not dedicate another whole disk to fault recovery and lose the complexity and slow write sometimes of raid glenn everhart original message from bmord URL mailto bmord URL sent tuesday september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm to webappsec securityfocus com secprog securityfocus subject use of base image delta image for automated recovery from attacks hi i was inspired by a mode of operation supported by vmware you can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine vm instances that base image is never altered by a vm instance instead each vm instance writes changes to its own redo log future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine this is described here thanks to duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list URL could this basic concept be used to easily make self fixing client server applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks even before those attacks have been discovered here is what i imagine the physical architectures of most production client server systems are layered for example your basic web application might have a web server running apache connected to an application server running some jNUMBERee or net business logic connected to a database server for persistence the only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server and even here you often put the static rdbms software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition it is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next other paritions may need to be writable for say swap space but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot when someone cracks this system they will probably change an image that shouldn t be changed e g they might leverage a buffer overflow in iis or apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server but what if the web server ran off a base image writing changes to a delta or redo partition and then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted the downtime involved for each machine would be minimal because it is only deleting data rather than restoring from backup in a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible this base redo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware raid allowing for greater performance reliability and hack resistance this concept could also be applied to the application servers and even the database server partitions except for those partitions which contain the table data files of course does anyone do this already or is this a new concept or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that i don t yet know i use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems it would allow for the hardware separation of volatile and non volatile disk images it would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting operations only it

ham,hi everybody i m writing a web application in java tomcat jsp servlets database access with postgresql this will be released under the gpl and will eventually be useful as a framework for other web applications the application main focus is e commerce but not limited to that i would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the database but i have some problem figuring out the right approach above all how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server a problem that i was unable to solve is how to store keys for encryption decryption the api that i m using is the jca jdkNUMBER NUMBER x and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always i can serialize the object and store in the database but this is not the most secure approach this key is needed to decrypt data in the database but the database is accessible from the web application assuming that i can find a good and secure place where to store the database password i can use a different database with different user argh to complex and doesn t really solve the problem where i can found good documentation about this topic there is another approach that i would share with the list something i thought that can be of bit interest but probabily wrong and insecure after all i m a real beginner in secure programming and i m here to learn methods and technics first of all i need a secure way to keep database passwords secure so i have to keep them separate from the main server the right approach could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user not tomcat so it is not shared with other web services or worst the nobody user that has no shell login but has a default home directory or a place where it can hold passwords and keys the web application could then open an ssl connection could be done in the init method at server startup to get database passwords the small bean could check via code signature rmi whatever else that the source is the right one and handle all the database connections or give the db connection password to the main web application in this way we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in shared directories and also an attacker should get root bean user account to read data this is not perfect and works only if your provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java application that means really another server running in the background any suggestions thank you mario torre please avoid sending me word or powerpoint attachments see URL

ham, dunno about the other tools but spamassassin is a breeze spamassassin also adds other headers as well which give you more detail guido do you feel capable of writing such a tool it doesn t look too guido hard sure but at the moment i have to stop reading email for a few hours and do some real work i ll see if i can modify URL suitably over the weekend skip 
ham,guido van rossum wrote i personally don t think imap has a bright future but for people who do use it that s certainly a good approach writing an imap server is a non trivial task the specification is huge and clients do all kinds of weird stuff pop is very easy in comparison perhaps you could forward messages to a special address or save them in a special folder to mark them as false negatives alternatively perhaps there could be a separate protocol and client that could be used to review additions to the training set each day a few random spam and ham messages could be grabbed as candidates someone would periodically startup the client review the candidates reclassify or remove any messages they don t like and add them to the training set neil 
ham, ns neil schemenauer nas python ca writes ns writing an imap server is a non trivial task that s what i ve been told by everyone i ve talked to who s actually tried to write one ns alternatively perhaps there could be a separate protocol and ns client that could be used to review additions to the training ns set each day a few random spam and ham messages could be ns grabbed as candidates someone would periodically startup the ns client review the candidates reclassify or remove any ns messages they don t like and add them to the training set i think people will be much more motivated to report spam than ham i like the general approach that copies of random messages will be sequestered for some period of time before they re assumed to be ham matched with a simple spam reporting scheme this could keep the training up to date with little effort i ve sketched out an approach a listserver like mailman could do along these lines and if i get some free time i ll hack something together i like the idea of a pop proxy which is classifying messages as they re pulled from the server the easiest way for such a beast to be notified of spam might be to simply save the spam in a special folder or file that the pop proxy would periodically consult barry 
ham,on fri NUMBER sep NUMBER guido van rossum wrote quite independently from testing and tuning the algorithm i d like to think about deployment eventually individuals and postmasters should be able to download a spambayes software distribution answer a few configuration questions about their mail setup training and false positives and install it as a filter a more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that can easily be used by individuals since we re more likely to find individuals willing to risk this than postmasters my impression is that a pre collected corpus would not fit most individuals very well but each individual or group should collect their own corpus one problem that comes upp immediately individuals are lazy if i currently get NUMBER spam and NUMBER ham a day and i ll have to press the delete button once for each spam i ll be happy to press the spam button instead however if in addition have to press a ham button for each ham it starts to look much less like a win to me add the time to install and setup the whole machinery and i ll just keep hitting delete the suggestions so far have been to hook something on the delete action that adds a message to the ham corpus i see two problems with this the ham will be a bit skewed mail that i keep around without deleting will not be counted secondly if i by force of habit happen to press the delete key instead of the spam key i ll end up with spam in the ham anyways i would like to look for a way to deal with spam in the ham the obvious thing to do is to trigger on the spam button and at that time look for messages similar to the deleted one in the ham corpus and simply remove them to do this we need a way to compare two word count histograms to see how similar they are any ideas also i personally would prefer to not see the spam at all if they get bounced preferably already in the smtp false positives become the senders problem to rewrite to remove the spam smell in a well tuned system then there spam corpus will be much smaller than the ham corpus so it would be possible to be slightly over agressive when clearing potential spam from the ham corpus this should make it easier to keep it clean having a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus there s less need to worry about it getting there by mistake and we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus that didn t get deleted by the spam filtering it might also be useful to have a way to remove messages from the spam corpus in case of user ooops paul 
ham, i guess mua level filtering is just a fallback for people who don t have NUMBER a burning all consuming hatred of junk mail NUMBER root access to all mail servers they rely on and NUMBER the ability and inclination to install an mta with every bell and whistle tweaked to keep out junk mail sure but for most people changing their company s or isp s server requires years of lobbying while they have total and immediate control over their own mua that said i agree that we should offer a good solution to postmasters and i trust that your ideas are right on the mark guido van rossum home page URL 
ham,i think one step towards deployment is creating a re usable tokenizer for mail messages the current codebase doesn t expose an easy to use or easy to customize tokenizer the timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical knowledge about how to parse mail messages but the module wasn t designed for re use i d like to see a module that can take a single message or a collection of messages and tokenize each one i d like to see the tokenize by customizable too tim had to exclude some headers from his test data because there were particular biases in the test data if other people have test data without those biases they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include them or exclude others jeremy

ham, tp a false positive really has to work hard then eh the long tp quote of a nigerian scam letter is one of the two that made tp it and spamprob looked at all this stuff before deciding it tp was spam here s an interesting thing to test discriminate words differently if they are on a line that starts with or to catch styles like above that the first occurance on a line of or is to eliminate html then again it may not be worth trying to un false positive that nigerian scam quote barry 
ham,so then guido van rossum guido python org is all like basic procmail usage goes something like this NUMBERfw spamassassin p NUMBER x spam status yes spam do you feel capable of writing such a tool it doesn t look too hard not to beat a dead horse but that s exactly what my spamcan package did for those just tuning in spamcan is a thingy i wrote before i knew about tim co s work on this crazy stuff you can download it from URL but i m not going to work on it anymore i m currently writing a new one based on classifier and timtest s booty kicking tokenizer i ll probably have something soon like maybe half an hour and no it s not too hard the hard part is storing the data somewhere i don t want to use zodb as i d like something a person can just drop in with a default python install so anydbm is looking like my best option i already have a setup like this using xavier leroy s spamoracle which does the same sort of thing you call it from procmail it adds a new header and then you can filter on that header really easy here s how i envision this working everybody gets four new mailboxes train eggs train spam trained eggs trained spam you copy all your spam and eggs into the train boxes as you get it how frequently you do this would be up to you but you d get better results if you did it more often and you d be wise to always copy over anything which was misclassified then every night the spam fairy swoops down and reads through your folders learning about what sorts of things you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam after she s done she moves your mail into the trained folders this would work for anybody using imap on a unix box or folks who read their mail right off the server i ve spoken with some fellows at work about exchange and they seem to beleive that exchange exports appropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail client to bind the key s to move to train spam and h to move to train eggs eventually if enough people used this sort of thing it d start showing up in mail clients that s the delete as spam button paul graham was talking about the hormel company might not think well of using the word ham as the opposite of spam and they ve been amazingly cool about the use of their product name for things thus far so i propose we start calling non spam something more innocuous and more monty pythonic such as eggs neale 
ham, jeremy hylton i think one step towards deployment is creating a re usable tokenizer for mail messages the current codebase doesn t expose an easy to use or easy to customize tokenizer tokenize couldn t be easier to use it takes a string argument and produces a stream of tokens whether via explicit list or generator or tuple or doesn t matter all the tokenize functions in URL and URL are freely interchangeable this way note that we have no evidence to support that a customizable tokenizer would do any good or if it would in which ways customization could be helpful that s a research issue on which no work has been done the timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical knowledge about how to parse mail messages but the module wasn t designed for re use that s partly a failure of imagination wink splitting out all knowledge of tokenization is just a large block cut and paste there it s done change the from timtoken import tokenize at the top to use any other tokenizer now if you want to make it easier still feel free to check in something better i d like to see a module that can take a single message or a collection of messages and tokenize each one the msg and msgstream classes in URL are a start at that but it s hard to do anything truly useful here when people use all sorts of different physical representations for email msgs mboxes in various formats one file per folder one file per msg skip s gzipped gimmick if you re a python coder wink you should find it very easy to change the guts of msg and msgstream to handle your peculiar scheme defining interfaces for these guys should be done i d like to see the tokenize by customizable too tim had to exclude some headers from his test data because there were particular biases in the test data if other people have test data without those biases they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include them or exclude others this sounds like a bottomless pit to me and there s no easier way to customize than to edit the code as readme txt still says though massive refactoring would help hop to it 
ham,i think that when considering deployment a solution that supports all python platforms and not just the l unix crowd is desirable mac and pc users are more apt to be using a commercial mua that s unlikely to offer hooking ability at least not easily as mentioned elsewhere even l unix users may find an mua solution easier to use then getting it added to their mta sysops make programmers look like flaming liberals my notion of a solution for windows outlook has been as guido described a client server client side does popNUMBER imap mapi fetching of which i m only going to implement popNUMBER initially potentially on several hosts spamhams the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message qmail style the mua accesses this ethunk as a server to obtain all the ham spam is retained in the ethunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection and training of spam filter and the ham will go forward after being used for training on the next mua fetch ethunk would sit on a timer for always online users but i am not clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme outbound mail would use a direct path from the mua to the mta hopefully all muas can split the host fetch send url s imo end users are likely to be more intested in n way classification if this is available the simple viewer could be enhanced to support viewing via folders and at least for me the outlook nightmare is over i would use this as my only mua n b according to my recent readings the best n way classifier uses something called a support vector machine svm which is NUMBER NUMBER more accurate then naive bayes nb i wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code that way it could be dropped into whatever harness that suited the user s situation david leblanc seattle wa usa 
ham, i wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code that way it could be dropped into whatever harness that suited the user s situation i see no reason to restrict the project to developing the classifier and leave the deployment to others attempts at deployment in the real world will surely provide additional feedback for the classifier guido van rossum home page URL

ham, note that header names are case insensitive so this one s no different than mime version similarly other headers in your list ignoring case here may or may not help that s for experiment to decide it s plausible that case is significant if e g a particular spam mailing package generates unusual case or a particular clueless spammer misconfigures his package i found it made no difference for my testing the brilliance of anthony s just count them scheme is that it requires no thought so can t be fooled wink header lines that are evenly distributed across spam and ham will turn out to be worthless indicators prob near NUMBER NUMBER so do no harm zactly i started off doing clever clever things and as always with this stuff found that stupid with a rock beats smart with scissors every time anthony baxter anthony interlink com au it s never too late to have a happy childhood 
ham, looks like your ham corpus by and large has to jeremy URL in a header while your spam corpus by and large doesn t but this one does interestingly for me one of the highest value spam indicators was the name of the mail host that the spam was delivered to in the to line so mail to info URL was pretty much a dead cert for the filters anthony baxter anthony interlink com au it s never too late to have a happy childhood 
ham, jeremy hylton wrote then i tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the words in the header and emitted like this s s hdr word that worked too well the received and date headers helped the classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is new heh i hit the same problem but the other way round when i first started playing with this i d collected spam for a week or two then mixed it up with randomly selected messages from my mail boxes course it instantly picked up on received NUMBER as a non ham curse that too smart for me software still it s probably a good thing to note in the documentation about the software when collecting spam ham make _sure_ you try and collect from the same source anthony anthony baxter anthony interlink com au it s never too late to have a happy childhood 
ham, course it instantly picked up on received NUMBER as a non ham spam sigh anthony baxter anthony interlink com au it s never too late to have a happy childhood 
ham,there seem to be two drivers for the classifier now neale pickett s URL and the original URL according to the readme txt URL hasn t been kept up to date is there anything in there that isn t covered by URL about the only useful feature of URL that URL doesn t yet copy is u which calculates spamness for an entire mailbox this feature can easily be copied into URL URL also has a large collection of tokenizers but URL rules so i m not sure how interesting that is now therefore i propose to nuke URL after adding a u feature anyone against i imagine that skip or barry might have a stake in URL tim seems to have moved all code he s working to other modules guido van rossum home page URL 
ham, i actually like neale s x spam disposition header i just wonder if maybe we should choose something with a different prefix than x spam so that people don t confuse it with spamassassin all of whose headers begin with that prefix also some sort of version information would be useful perhaps the cvs version number for the classifier module could be tacked on skip 
ham, skip montanaro wrote i actually like neale s x spam disposition header i just wonder if maybe we should choose something with a different prefix than x spam so that people don t confuse it with spamassassin all of whose headers begin with that prefix i think it s fine in general just so long as no one checks in anything that puts it into my test corpus or alternately whatever is chosen should be ignored by the tokenizer i know my mail host interlink runs sa but i also run it with my own set of rules and scores i don t want my spam filter to be getting messed up by an upstream spam filter 
ham, guido therefore i propose to nuke URL after adding a u feature guido anyone against i imagine that skip or barry might have a stake guido in URL tim seems to have moved all code he s working to guido other modules no argument here skip 
ham, if the frequency of my laptop s disk chirps are any indication i d say hammie is about NUMBER NUMBERx faster than spamassassin skip

ham,so then tim peters tim one comcast net is all like i m not sure what you re doing but suspect you re storing individual wordinfo pickles if so most of the administrative pickle bloat is due to that and doesn t happen if you pickle an entire classifier instance directly yeah that s exactly what i was doing i didn t realize i was incurring administrative pickle bloat this way i m specifically trying to make things faster and smaller so i m storing individual wordinfo pickles into an anydbm dict keyed by token the result is that it s almost NUMBER times faster to score messages one per run our of procmail NUMBERs vs NUMBER NUMBERs however it does say all over the place that the goal of this project isn t to make the fastest or the smallest implementation so i guess i ll hold off doing any further performance tuning until the goal starts to point more in that direction NUMBER seconds is probably fast enough for people to use it in their procmailrc which is what i was after if you re desparate to save memory write a subclass that s probably what i ll do if i get too antsy trying to think of ways to sneak administrative pickle boat into casual conversation neale 
ham, yeah that s exactly what i was doing i didn t realize i was incurring administrative pickle bloat this way i m specifically trying to make things faster and smaller so i m storing individual wordinfo pickles into an anydbm dict keyed by token the result is that it s almost NUMBER times faster to score messages one per run our of procmail NUMBERs vs NUMBER NUMBERs this is very worthwhile however it does say all over the place that the goal of this project isn t to make the fastest or the smallest implementation so i guess i ll hold off doing any further performance tuning until the goal starts to point more in that direction NUMBER seconds is probably fast enough for people to use it in their procmailrc which is what i was after maybe i batch messages using fetchmail don t ask why and adding NUMBER seconds per message for a batch of NUMBER not untypical feels like a real wait to me guido van rossum home page URL

ham, choose something with a different prefix than x spam so that people don t confuse it with spamassassin neale how about x spambayes disposition or x hammie disposition if neale there ll be other classifier front ends i kinda like hammie your front end was there first so i suspect it will rule the front end roost s

ham, guido perhaps more useful would be if tim could check in the pickle s generated by one of his training runs so that others can see how tim s training data performs against their own corpora i did that yesterday but seems like nobody bit just in case wink i uploaded a new version just now since mincount went away unknown_spamprob is much less likely and there s almost nothing that can be pruned away so the file is about NUMBERx larger now URL this could also be the starting point for a self contained distribution you ve got to start with something and training with python list data seems just as good as anything else the only way to know anything here is for someone to try it

ham,before we get too far down this road what do people think of creating a spambayes package containing classifier and tokenizer this is just to minimize clutter in site packages skip 
ham, jeremy hylton here s clarification of why i did that s pretty much what i had guessed thanks one more to try first test results using tokenizer tokenizer tokenize_headers unmodified second test results using mboxtest mytokenizer tokenize_headers this uses all headers except received data and x from_ try the latter again but call the base tokenize_headers too 
ham, before we get too far down this road what do people think of creating a spambayes package containing classifier and tokenizer this is just to minimize clutter in site packages too early imo if you mean to leave the various other tools out of it if and when we package this perhaps we should use barry s trick from the email package for making the package itself the toplevel dir of the distribution rather than requiring an extra directory level just so the package can be a subdir of the distro guido van rossum home page URL 
ham, guido on the classifier pickle on sf i downloaded and played with it a bit but had no time to do anything systematic cool it correctly recognized a spam that slipped through sa ditto but it also identified as spam everything in my inbox that had any mime structure or html parts and several messages in my saved zope geeks list that happened to be using mime and or html do you know why the strangest implied claim there is that it hates mime independent of html for example the spamprob of content type text plain in that pickle is under NUMBER NUMBER content type multipart alternative gets NUMBER NUMBER but that s not a killer clue and one bit of good content will more than cancel it out wrt hating html possibilities include NUMBER it really had to do with something other than mime html NUMBER these are pure html not multipart alternative with a text plain part so that the tags aren t getting stripped the pickled classifier despises all hints of html due to its URL heritage NUMBER these are multipart alternative with a text plain part but the latter doesn t contain the same text as the text html part for example as anthony reported perhaps the text plain part just says something like this is an hmtl message if it s NUMBER it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize meaning even if it is pure html strip the tags anyway in fact i d like to do that and default it to true the extreme hatred of html on tech lists strikes me as umm extreme wink so i guess i ll have to retrain it yes you told me so that would be a different experiment i m certainly curious to see whether jeremy s much worse than mine error rates are typical or aberrant 
ham, but it also identified as spam everything in my inbox that had any mime structure or html parts and several messages in my saved zope geeks list that happened to be using mime and or html do you

ham, i also looked in more detail at some f p s in my geeks traffic the first one s a doozie that s the term right it has lots of html clues that are apparently ignored the clues below are loaded with snippets unique to html like br i meant to say that they were NUMBER NUMBER clues cancelled out by NUMBER NUMBER clues but that s wrong too it looks i haven t grokked this part of your code yet this one has way more than NUMBER clues and it seems the classifier basically ended up counting way more NUMBER NUMBER than NUMBER NUMBER clues and no others made it into the list i thought it was looking for clues with values in between apparently it found none that weren t exactly NUMBER NUMBER that sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues this happened to be the longest one but there were quite a few similar ones i wonder if there s anything we can learn from looking at the clues and the html it was heavily marked up html with ads in the sidebar but the body text was a serious discussion of oo and soft coding with lots of highly technical words as clues including zope and zeo that there are any NUMBER NUMBER clues in here means the scheme ran out of anything interesting to look at adding in more header lines should cure that are there any minable but unmined header lines in your corpus left or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make progress there the seventh was similar i scanned a bunch more until i got bored and most of them were either of the first form brief text with url followed by quoted html from website if those were text plain the html tags should have been stripped i m still confused about this part no sorry these were all of the following structure multipart mixed text plain brief text plus url s text html long html copied from website i guess you get this when you click on mail this page in some browsers that html tags aren t getting stripped remains the biggest mystery to me still this seems confused jeremy didn t use my trained classifier pickle he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora that s an entirely different kind of experiment from the one you re trying indeed you re the only one so far to report results from trying my pickle on their own email and i never expected that to work well it s a much bigger mystery to me why jeremy got such relatively worse results from training his own and he s the only one so far to report results from that experiment i think it s still corpus size guido van rossum home page URL 
ham, guido i meant to say that they were NUMBER NUMBER clues cancelled out by NUMBER NUMBER clues but that s wrong too it looks i haven t grokked this part of your code yet this one has way more than NUMBER clues and it seems the classifier basically ended up counting way more NUMBER NUMBER than NUMBER NUMBER clues and no others made it into the list i thought it was looking for clues with values in between apparently it found none that weren t exactly NUMBER NUMBER there s a brief discussion of this before the definition of max_discriminators all clues with prob min_spamprob and max_spamprob are saved in min and max lists and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap then the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number of clues in the longer list whatever remains of the longer list if anything is then fed into the nbest heap too but no more than max_discriminators of them in no case do more than max_discriminators clues enter into the final probability calculation but all of the min and max lists go into the list of clues else you d have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring and massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual review is needed in your specific case the excess of clues in the longer max_spamprob list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap and that s why you didn t see anything other than NUMBER NUMBER and NUMBER NUMBER before adding these special lists the outcome when faced with many NUMBER NUMBER and NUMBER NUMBER clues was too often a coin toss whichever flavor just happened to appear max_discriminators NUMBER NUMBER times first determined the final outcome that sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues this happened to be the longest one but there were quite a few similar ones i just beat it wink a tokenization scheme that folds case and ignores punctuation and strips a trailing s from words and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams turned up a low probability very long spam with a list of NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER clues and NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER clues yikes i wonder if there s anything we can learn from looking at the clues and the html it was heavily marked up html with ads in the sidebar but the body text was a serious discussion of oo and soft coding with lots of highly technical words as clues including zope and zeo no matter how often it says zope it gets only one NUMBER NUMBER clue from doing so ditto for zeo in contrast html markup has many unique words that get NUMBER NUMBER btw this is a clear case where the assumption of conditionally independent word probabilities is utterly bogus e g the probability that body appears in a message is highly correlated with the prob of br appearing by treating them as independent naive bayes grossly misjudges the probability that both appear and the only thing you get in return is something that can actually be computed wink read the what about html section in URL from the very start i ve been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at URL and html decorations have so far been too strong a clue to justify ignoring it in that specific context i haven t done anything geared toward personal email including the case of non mailing list email that happens to go through URL i d prefer to strip html tags from everything but last time i tried that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora the full test results with and without html tag stripping is included in the what about html comment block but as the comment block also says xxx so if another way is found to slash the f n rate the decision here xxx not to strip html from html only msgs should be revisited and we ve since done several things that gave significant f n rate reductions i should test that again now are there any minable but unmined header lines in your corpus left almost all of them apart from mime decorations that appear in both headers and bodies like content type the only header lines the base tokenizer looks at now are subject from x mailer and organization or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make progress there i would need different data yes my ham is too polluted with mailman header decorations which i may or may not be able to clean out but fudging the data is a mortal sin and i haven t changed a byte so far and my spam too polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it in particular i have to skip to and received headers now and i suspect they re going to be very valuable in real life for example i don t even catch undisclosed recipients in the to header now no sorry these were all of the following structure multipart mixed text plain brief text plus url s text html long html copied from website ah that explains why the html tags didn t get stripped i d again offer to add an optional argument to tokenize so that they d get stripped here too but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like a loss wink this seems confused jeremy didn t use my trained classifier pickle he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora i think it s still corpus size i reported on tests i ran with random samples of NUMBER spams and NUMBER hams from my corpus that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predicting on sets of those sizes and while that did harm the error rates the error rates i saw were still much better than jeremy reported when using NUMBER of each ah a full test run just finished on the tokenization scheme that folds case and ignores punctuation and strips a trailing s from words and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams this is the code tokenize everything in the body lastw for w in word_re findall text n len w make sure this range matches in tokenize_word if NUMBER n NUMBER if w NUMBER s w w NUMBER yield w if lastw yield lastw w lastw w elif n NUMBER lastw for t in tokenize_word w yield t where word_re re compile r w xNUMBER xff this at least doubled the process size over what s done now it helped the f n rate significantly but probably hurt the f p rate the f p rate is too low with only NUMBER hams per run to be confident about changes of such small absolute magnitude NUMBER NUMBER is a single message in the f p table false positive percentages NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER tied NUMBER NUMBER

ham, before we get too far down this road what do people think of creating a spambayes package containing classifier and tokenizer this is just to minimize clutter in site packages guido too early imo if you mean to leave the various other tools out guido of it well i mentioned classifier and tokenize only because i thought they were the only importable modules the rest represent script level code right guido if and when we package this perhaps we should use barry s trick guido from the email package for making the package itself the toplevel guido dir of the distribution rather than requiring an extra directory guido level just so the package can be a subdir of the distro that would be perfect i tried in the naive way last night but wound up with all py files in the package which wasn t my intent skip

ham,neil trained a classifier using NUMBER sets with about NUMBER ham and spam in each we re missing half his test run results due to a URL bug since fixed the before custom fiddling figures on the NUMBER reported runs were false positive percentages NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER total unique fp NUMBER false negative percentages NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER total unique fn NUMBER the total unique figures counts all NUMBER runs it s just the individual run fp and fn percentages we re missing for NUMBER runs jeremy reported these before custom fiddling figures on NUMBER sets with about NUMBER ham and spam in each false positive percentages NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER total unique fp NUMBER false negative percentages NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER total unique fn NUMBER so things are clearly working much better for neil both reported significant improvements in both f n and f p rates by folding in more header lines neal added received analysis to the base tokenizer s header analysis and jeremy skipped the base tokenizer s header analysis completely but added base subject line like but case folded tokenization for almost all header lines excepting only received data x from_ and i suspect all those starting with x vm when i try NUMBER random pairs of NUMBER ham NUMBER spam subsets in my test data i see false positive percentages NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER total unique fp NUMBER false negative percentages NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER total unique fn NUMBER this is much closer to what neil saw but still looks better another run on a disjoint NUMBER random pairs looked much the same total unique fp rose to NUMBER and fn fell to NUMBER on a third run with another set of disjoint NUMBER random pairs likewise with fp NUMBER and fn NUMBER so i m pretty confident that it s not going to matter which random subsets of NUMBER i take from my data it s hard to conclude anything given jeremy s much worse results if they were in line with neil s results i d suspect that i ve over tuned the algorithm to statistical quirks in my corpora 
ham, tim one effect of getting rid of mincount is that it latches on more strongly to rare clues now and those can be unique to the corpus trained on e g one trained ham says gryndlplyx and a followup new ham quotes it this may be a systematic bias in the testing procedure in real life msgs come ordered in time say there s a thread that spans n messages on URL in our testing setup we ll train on a random sampling throughout its whole lifetime and test likewise new ham in the middle of this thread gets benefit from that we trained on msgs that appeared both before and after it in real life it s quite plausible that the f p rate would rise without this effect in real life at any given time some number of ham threads will just be starting their lives and if they re at all unusual the trained data will know little to nothing about them 
ham, greg ward case of headers is definitely helpful spamassassin has a rule for it if you have headers like date or subject you get a few more points across my data all caps date subject to etc indeed appear only in the spam collections otoh they don t appear often less than NUMBER of spam messages have at least one of these all cap header lines but when i m fighting what are now sub NUMBER f n rates even rare clues can help 
ham, neale pickett if you can spare the memory you might get better performance in this case using the pickle store since it only has to go to disk once but boy does it ever go to disk i can t think of anything obvious to speed things up once it s all loaded into memory though on my box the current system scores about NUMBER msgs per second starting in memory of course while that can be a drag while waiting for one of my full test runs to complete one of those scores a message more than NUMBER NUMBER times and trains more than NUMBER NUMBER times i ve got no urge to do any speed optimizations if i were using this for my own email i d never notice the drag guido will bitch like hell about waiting an extra second for his NUMBER msg batches to score but he s the boss so he bitches about everything wink that s profiler territory and profiling is exactly the kind of optimization i just said i wasn t going to do i haven t profiled yet but suspect there aren t any egregious hot spots NUMBER gram ing of long words with high bit characters is likely overly expensive when it happens but it doesn t happen that often and as an approach to non english languages it sucks anyway i e there s no point speeding something that ought to be replaced entirely 
ham, guido there seem to be two drivers for the classifier now neale pickett s URL and the original URL according to the readme txt URL hasn t been kept up to date it seemed that way to me when i ripped the classifier out of it i don t think anyone has touched it after is there anything in there that isn t covered by URL someone else will have to answer that i don t use gbayes or hammie at least not yet about the only useful feature of URL that URL doesn t yet copy is u which calculates spamness for an entire mailbox this feature can easily be copied into URL that s been done now right URL also has a large collection of tokenizers but URL rules so i m not sure how interesting that is now those tokenizers are truly trivial to rewrite from scratch if they re interesting the tiny spam ham collections in gbayes are also worthless now the self test feature didn t do anything except print its results URL since became doctest ed and verifies that some basic machinery actually delivers what it s supposed to deliver therefore i propose to nuke URL after adding a u feature NUMBER here anyone against

ham, brad clements just curious if subject line capitalization can be used as an indicator either the percentage of characters that are caps or percentage starting with a capital letter if number of words xx supply a mod to URL and i ll test it eventually wink note that the tokenizer already preserves case in subject line words because experiment showed that this was better than folding case away in this specific context but experiment also showed against my expectations that preserving case everywhere didn t make a significant difference to either error rate the subject line is a special case for this

ham, followups to spambayes URL please unless you re specifically concerned about some particular bit of email policy for URL ok after much fiddling with and tweaking of etc exim eximNUMBER conf and etc exim local_scan py on URL i am fairly confident that i can start harvesting all incoming email at a moment s notice for the record here s how it all works eximNUMBER conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file etc exim harvest does not exist that is any junk mail condition that can be detected by exim acls access control lists is handled entirely in eximNUMBER conf the message is rejected before it ever gets to local_scan py this covers such diverse cases as message from known spammer reject after every rcpt to command no message id header and NUMBER bit chars in subject both rejected after the message headers body are read the main things i have changed in the absence of etc exim harvest are don t check for NUMBER bit chars in from header the vast majority of hits for this test were bounces from some asian isp the remaining hits should be handled by spamassassin do header sender verification ie ensure that there s a verifiable email address in at least one of from reply to and sender as late as possible because it requires dns lookups which can be slow and can also make messages that should have been rejected merely be deferred if those dns lookups timeout if etc exim harvest exists then the behaviour of all of those acls in eximNUMBER conf suddenly changes instead of rejecting recipients or messages they add an x reject header to the message this header is purely for internal use it records the name of the folder to which the rejected message should be saved and also gives the smtp error message which should ultimately be used to reject the message thus those messages will now be seen by local_scan py which now looks for the x reject header if found it uses the folder name specified there to save the message and then rejects it with the smtp error message also given in x reject currently x reject is retained in saved messages if a message was not tagged with x reject then local_scan py runs the usual virus and spam checks namely my homebrew scan for attachments with filenames that look like windows executables and a run through spamassassin the logic is basically this if virus folder virus else run through spamassassin if score NUMBER NUMBER folder rejected spam elif score NUMBER NUMBER folder caught spam finally local_scan py writes the message to the designated folder by far the biggest folder will be accepted the server handles NUMBER NUMBER incoming messages per day of which maybe NUMBER NUMBER are junk mail oops just realized i haven t written the code that actually saves the message d ohh also haven t written anything to discriminate personal email which i must do sigh finally the big catch waiting until after you ve read the message headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic because certain broken mtas including those used by some spammers don t consider a NUMBERxx after data as a permanent error but keep retrying d ohh this is a minor annoyance currently where a fair amount of stuff is rejected at rcpt to time but in harvest mode everything with the exception of people probing for open relays will be rejected at data time so i have cooked up something called the asbl or automated sender blacklist this is just a berkeley db file that maps sender_ip sender_address to an expiry time when local_scan rejects a message from sender_ip sender_address for whatever reason including finding an x reject header added by an acl in eximNUMBER conf it adds a record to the asbl with an expiry time NUMBER hours in the future meanwhile there s an acl in eximNUMBER conf that checks for records in the asbl if there s a record for the current sender_ip sender_address that hasn t expired yet we reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or body the downside of this from the point of view of corpus collection is that if some jerk is busily spamming URL one smtp connection per address we will most likely only get one copy this is a win if you re just thinking about reducing server load and bandwidth but i m not sure if it s helpful for training spam detectors tim happy harvesting greg greg ward gward python net URL budget s in the red let s tax religion dead kennedys

ham,url URL date not supplied we re trying to decide if fogbugz NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER should support custom fields historically i am opposed to custom fields in principle because they get abused people add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to harvard end result people don t enter bugs which is much much worse than not capturing all that information you can always page fault to get the information if the original report forgot it rather than having a field in every bug where you enter the version numbers of every dll on your machine this is an actual customer request information which is likely to be relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs why not just have the programmer assignee look at the bug first and if they think it might be dll version related only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking for the dll info similarly it s always tempting to add a field in which you ask for the os version in which the bug occurred this sounds logical but trust me adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing only reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first place only a small percentage of bugs are really os dependant and you can always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be relevant but then how do you search for say all bugs which only happen on windows NUMBERse aha you can t ever even with the custom field because not every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system so this search doesn t make sense in the first place the info wasn t captured do a full text search for NUMBERse and you ll find some of them life is imperfect life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of information a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in ram on the computer in question and while you re at it a photograph of the tester s workspace but the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_ which all else being equal takes priority over making it easy to find them i have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking package was so high ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the system because they didn t know what all those fields were the _real_ bug tracking happened in email post its and hallway conversations great a pretty common question we get on the customer service line is does fogbugz support custom fields rather than giving our usual answer no on purpose over the last few weeks i ve been saying can you please tell me what fields you would need we re trying to decide whether to implement that feature in NUMBER NUMBER and we want to know why people need it the interesting thing is almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in fogbugz _ and the other ones in my educated opinion shouldn t be fields and in fact our existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields one of our biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company and i myself wanted to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design but i didn t and they never needed it even though they had been keeping track of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields and they are happy and keep buying more site licenses but the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in our product gosh even filemaker has custom fields righto it s true and who am i to tell my customers they are wrong one person who i was talking to yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a built in field for this would have made their database confusing and inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved but it s still rude of me to tell customers that we don t have that feature _for their own good_ even though it usually is and we re losing some sales because of it sigh i guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so hard to use that people don t use it at least we won t lose any sales NUMBER URL

ham,url URL date NUMBER NUMBER NUMBERtNUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER so i was researching the history of the tilde because d told me that her company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any url with a tilde in it presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with remarkable accuracy a personal site and apparently her employer believes that reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time which to be honest is probably accurate given the nature of her work but never mind that i don t want to talk about corporate politics i want to talk about the tilde every command line loving geek will tell you that stands for NUMBER home directory NUMBER and cd will take you to your home directory cd username will take you to someone else s except on mac os x where it will take you to their public file sharing directory it is from this heritage that we can trace the present day practice of using tildes in urls to denote personal pages since one single system wide configuration allowed individual users to have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory or more commonly now that apache has taken over the world in their public_html subdirectory except on mac os x where if you turn on web sharing and point your browser to http localhost username you re actually being served files from that user s sites directory within their home directory but i don t want to talk about mac os x i want to talk about the tilde as with so many other things i find that jukka korpela NUMBER is the expert in this field jukka is no doubt a member of my karass NUMBER a word which google old habits die hard NUMBER feels is best explained by the personal site of eugene wallingford which like jukka s home page can not be referenced without a tilde in fact jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be used in urls NUMBER a treatise which i feel obliged to point out contains a tilde in its url clearly the tilde is underappreciated digging further we find this post of jukka s from NUMBER NUMBER in which we learn that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all but rather an odd character called the overline presumably to balance out the underline if indeed those sorts of things require balance there is balance in the universe to be sure but i am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard no matter the tilde was the tilde so that spanish typing types could type the ntilde now referenced in html as the named entity ntilde but somewhere along the line it morphed into a general purpose character with all sorts of geeky uses digging even further it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for NUMBER then an alternate for and its life as an overline replacement came even later jukka confirms this NUMBER and adds a timeline NUMBER for NUMBER for NUMBER for overline then june NUMBER NUMBER the watershed moment in an xNUMBER committee meeting when it was proposed NUMBER

ham,url URL date NUMBER NUMBER NUMBERtNUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER _clay shirky_ in praise of evolvable systems NUMBER this entire article could be rewritten to explain rss in fact let s do that if it were april fool s day the net s only official holiday and you wanted to design a NUMBER novelty format NUMBER to slip by the wNUMBERc as a joke it might look something like rss NUMBER NUMBERx NUMBER NUMBER it would specify limits on data values then remove them then specify required elements then make them optional thus silently breaking an unknown number of parsers around the world it would encourage use of entity encoded html in its most important element thus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user it would ignore years of standards work in other fields committing such egregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn t a guid and using an obsolete date format that couldn t easily be sorted by date its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core namespace without telling anyone or documenting them thus making it wholely resistant to dtd schema or validation of any kind after years of worldwide deployment it would completely reverse its add whatever you want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces which the spec would neither define nor elaborate on after adopting namespaces it would fail to deprecate any existing elements semantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use it would also fail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the same thing in two different ways thus ensuring mass confusion among producers and inconsistent behavior across consumers rss NUMBER NUMBERx and NUMBER NUMBER are the whoopee cushion and joy buzzer of syndication formats for anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata it s pretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication format we have the worst one possible except of course for all the others the problem with that list of rss deficiencies is that it is also a list of necessities NUMBER rss has flourished in a way that no other syndication format has not despite many of these qualities but because of them the very weaknesses that make rss so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it possible in the first place removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened up rss to a whole new category of producer the weblogger allowing encoded html in description let publishers reuse both their existing content and the existing rss infrastructure without requiring them to produce valid xhtml which could be embedded directly into an xml document social mores rather than technical rules prevent producers from intentionally introducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable display through unclosed html elements few publishing tools can produce real conforming guids and it doesn t matter because virtually all rss parsers are written in high level languages where handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes and handling bytecodes as for dates by convention an rss document is laid out in reverse chronological order and no one seems to be clamoring for more flexibility furthermore its almost babyish xml syntax so far from any serious computational framework where are the namespaces where is the document type description why is the aggregators enforcement of conformity so lax made it possible for anyone wanting an rss feed to write one the effects of this ease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts over the years to NUMBER do rss right NUMBER NUMBER most notably rss NUMBER NUMBER in the year NUMBER rss NUMBER NUMBER had three main benefits backward compatible with rss NUMBER NUMBER which was never widely deployed and which fell into obscurity as soon as the much simpler rss NUMBER NUMBER was introduced based on rdf specifically a serialization called rdf xml a spec which at the time and to this day continues to change or threaten to change two years later there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with parsers to consume rdf although many perl python net have third party rdf parsers in various states of development and conformance the release version is generally out of date cvs access is recommended you get the idea meanwhile rdf xml production tools are so inconsistent that even rdf experts recommend not using rdf tools to produce an rss NUMBER NUMBER feed if you want it to actually be read by any major rss aggregator despite the two year old promise of better tools NUMBER it is now the year NUMBER and i built my rss NUMBER NUMBER feed NUMBER in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the world NUMBER by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets into a textarea of an html form extensible through namespaces which as mentioned above have been haphazardly and poorly incorporated into rss NUMBER NUMBER where they appear to be flourishing evolvable formats NUMBER those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a thousand small ways NUMBER have three main characteristics that are germane to their eventual victories over strong centrally designed formats only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed my rss feed is an xml document produced by a template that i built in a textarea and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know nothing of xml and hack apart my feed with regular expressions the world is littered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools if everyone in the world had a perfect rdf parser at their disposal it would be trivial to produce and consume all the world s metadata in rdf without such perfect tools both production and consumption instantly become nightmares there is no middle ground what is is wrong because evolvable formats have always been adapted to earlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions they are always behind the times rss was being stretched with long descriptions optional titles and entity encoded html even before such practices were codified in the spec and long before all consumers could handle them no evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it faces finally orgel s rule named for the evolutionary biologist leslie orgel NUMBER NUMBER evolution is cleverer than you are NUMBER as with the list of rss s obvious deficiencies above it is easy to point out what is wrong with any evolvable system at any point in its life no one seeing rss NUMBER NUMBER and rss NUMBER NUMBER side by side could doubt that rss NUMBER NUMBER had the superior technology that it NUMBER did things right NUMBER however the ability to understand what is missing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central group can design a better system in the long haul designed formats start out strong and improve logarithmically evolvable formats start out weak and improve exponentially rss NUMBER NUMBER is not the perfect syndication format just the best one that s also currently practical infrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete partially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition NUMBER URL NUMBER URL

ham,url URL date not supplied feedback from my posting NUMBER about fogbugz NUMBER setup fell into four categories why make setup reversable instead you should collect all the information from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end there are a couple of things to understand here first of all even if you do everything in one batch at the end there s always a possibility that some step in the middle of the batch will fail and in that case a well behaved setup program will back out the steps that were already done there are well over NUMBER error messages in the string table for fogbugz setup so the number of things that can fail is not insignificant second it s not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages after they made the mistake for example early in the fogbugz setup process we prompt you to create an account for fogbugz to use img URL fogbugz setup screenshot the account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons none of which can be predicted before trying to create the account for example the password might not conform to the system password policy and different national versions of windows nt have different rules about accented letters in passwords betcha didn t know that it s better to tell the user about this problem right away so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the long install process later forcing the user to back up and fix it and even if you force the user to back up and fix it you still have to undo the first part of the work that you did before creating the account otherwise you ve left their system in an indeterminate state in any case i need to write code to create the account and delete the account in case something later fails i might as well call that code on this page of the wizard where i can display a useful error message and what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable well in order to upgrade fogbugz without requiring a reboot and we _never ever _require a reboot we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been keeping fogbugz files pinned down such as iis microsoft s web server so part one of the batch is stop iis now if part NUMBER fails for some reason it would be _extremely_ rude to leave iis not running and anyway it s not like i don t need to write the code for start iis for the end of the batch so the code to rollback stop iis is already written no big deal i just need to call it at the right place i think one reason that people think you should gather all the info and then do all the work is because with very large installation programs that are very slow this is a polite way to waste less of the user s time indeed even fogbugz setup does NUMBER of its work at the very end but the create account operation is so fast that principle simply doesn t apply here even our NUMBER of the work phase takes well under a minute most of which is spent waiting for iis to stop and start why did you use vc mfc surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself has admitted by now that delphi NUMBER is more productive first of all leave your language religious fanaticism at the usenet door somehow i managed to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious arguments are unbelievably boring secondly even if delphi were more productive the only pertinent question since i am writing the code is _what is more productive for joel spolsky_ and i don t know delphi at all but i know winNUMBER mfc and vc _really really well_ so while i might not outcode a good delphi programmer i would definitely outcode a completely inexperienced delphi programmer which is me certainly over a short NUMBER week project third many of the things i needed to do in this setup program are things like grant the logon as service privilege to an account this is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this is to search the microsoft knowlege base and the web in general when you search the web in general for how to do fancy things with windows nt what you find is about NUMBER c code maybe NUMBER vb code and NUMBER everything else yes i know i could translate the c code into delphi assuming i was a sophisticated delphi programmer not a completely inexperienced delphi programmer but that costs as much productivity as i would supposedly gain from your supposedly more productive programming language and fourth i already had about NUMBER of the code i needed for setup in mfc format from fogbugz NUMBER NUMBER setup and a library i ve been using for years to make wizards why make setup at all you already have your customers money good setup programs don t increase sales this was actually the smartest question and made me think the hardest i came up with three reasons

home lisa pierce has ground beef and roasts frozen vegetables and french fries even a couple of popsicles what she doesn t have is the meat of the moose she hit and killed with her car on nov NUMBER the moose that was rightfully hers but instead went to a neighbor the lack of it has her embroiled in a fight with the york county sheriff s department to get back what she says she is owed i think the deputy thought he was doing me a favor said pierce i m a woman and he just neglected to think that i would want it the moose is gone i know that now i want to be compensated for the meat whether or not that happens is uncertain her experience though highlights a law some mainers may not be aware of but should get to know during this peak time of deer versus car accidents as the animals in their mating season come out of the woods the law is simple a big game carcass caught by a car be it a moose deer or bear goes to the person who hits it as long as a law enforcement officer is called to the scene and the vehicle is damaged in the accident it comes up quite often in maine say officials last year there were NUMBER NUMBER cases of vehicles and deer colliding on maine roads and NUMBER accidents involving moose according to mark latti spokesman for the maine warden service in a state of what NUMBER NUMBER million with only NUMBER NUMBER licensed hunters i don t know how many motor vehicle drivers would know how to dress out a moose said latti you do have the option of keeping it which for some people can be valuable compensation for a damaged car farm grown deer meat can retail for NUMBER to NUMBER per pound in stores and a butchered or dressed moose which can t be bought or sold anywhere in maine can produce hundreds of pounds of food latti said when it comes to moose the law has been abused since its inception in NUMBER every now and then an officer will issue a summons to a driver for intentionally killing a moose with a car that kind of hunting makes no sense to latti hitting a moose even at a slow speed is no laughing matter large adult moose can weigh up to NUMBER NUMBER pounds and can be more than NUMBER feet tall since the bulk of their weight is above the hood level of most cars their bodies often come crashing through windshields in collisions more often than not crashes like these damage the vehicle the people inside and the animal sometimes they are fatal in NUMBER latti said there were six moose related fatalities after that when the number of moose hunting permits went from NUMBER NUMBER to NUMBER NUMBER there were less maine had three moose related fatalities in NUMBER one in NUMBER and two this year so far said stephen mccausland spokesman for the maine public safety department pierce considers herself lucky that she and the three children in her car did not become part of that statistic early on election day but she also feels cheated by the whole situation after all her car was totaled on the morning of the accident pierce was taking her two children and a neighbor s son to school in her NUMBER dodge dynasty she said she was going along at about NUMBER mph on a well traveled road when a moose came out of nowhere by the time my brain could see moose he was part of my windshield she said pierce is well aware of the law so as she sat in the ambulance with the children being treated for cuts and bruises she thought about the moose but the four of them were transferred to the hospital before she could deal with it so she said she wasn t able to follow up on the animal until later that day when she inquired she was told the deputy on the scene gave the fully racked bull moose to a neighbor who showed up with a tractor her neighbor she said subsequently offered her the moose for the NUMBER it took him to carry it away money she didn t think she should spend by the time she contacted the attorney general s office on nov NUMBER to complain about the deputy giving her moose away the neighbor s price had gone up another NUMBER for the cost of butchering NUMBER pounds of meat and when she called york county chief deputy maurice ouellette to complain that she should be compensated for the moose because it was the officer s fault that she didn t have it ouellette told her he could not give her cash and the best he could do was to give her the next moose struck in york county at that point in time it became an issue of not wanting moose anymore but wanting money ouellette said that conversation and a similar one she had with york county sheriff phil cote left pierce enraged and she now feels the issue has gone beyond the moose but the circumstances that brought her to this point are not surprising to other officials it s the officer s discretion said latti and if the officer feels the person can t immediately remove the animal he s got to think of public safety and other people on the roadway if someone is worried about her children in her car the last thing a law enforcement officer wants to ask is if she wants the moose maine state police trooper jeremy forbes said when he arrives at accidents that involve a serious injury to a person the issue of who gets the animal deer or moose becomes secondary the priorities are the injuries and getting people to the hospital he said if they are really hurt and going to the hospital the animal can t wait so we ll probably give it to the next person who stops by this is not comforting to pierce she said the deputy could have come to the ambulance and asked her what she wanted to do with the moose with her boyfriend a hunter nearby she could have easily taken care of the animal herself she knows her situation is probably a lost cause but she hopes other people especially other women do not have the same experience what about people who don t know the law she said standing up for my rights has just been a big headache staff writer giselle goodman can be contacted at NUMBER NUMBER or at ggoodman URL to unsubscribe from this

ham,the material appended below comes from martin gardner s book _fads and fallacies in the name of science_ revised and expanded edition published in NUMBER by dover publications inc new york city bill bennetta _________________________________________________ m ost pseudo scientists have a number of characteristics in common first and most important of these traits is that cranks work in almost total isolation in the sense of having no fruitful contacts with fellow researchers the modern crank insists that his isolation is not desired on his part it is due he claims to the prejudice of established scientific groups against new ideas the modern pseudo scientist stands entirely outside the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are introduced and evaluated he works in isolation he does not send his findings to the recognized journals or if he does they are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases are excellent in most cases the crank is not well enough informed to write a paper with even a surface resemblance to a significant study as a consequence he finds himself excluded the journals and societies and almost universally ignored by the competent workers in his field in fact the reputable scientist does not even know of the crank s existence unless his work is given widespread publicity through non academic channels or unless the scientist makes a hobby of collecting crank literature the eccentric is forced therefore to tread a lonely way he speaks before organizations he himself has founded contributes to journals he himself may edit and until recently publishes books only when he or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed privately a second characteristic of the pseudo scientist which greatly strengthens his isolation is a tendency toward paranoia there are five ways in which the sincere pseudo scientist s paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited NUMBER he considers himself a genius NUMBER he regards his colleagues without exception as ignorant blockheads everyone is out of step except himself frequently he insults his opponents by accusing them of stupidity dishonesty or other base motives if they ignore him he takes this to mean his arguments are unanswerable if they retaliate in kind this strengthens his delusion that he is battling scoundrels NUMBER he believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated against NUMBER he has a strong compulsion to focus his attacks on the greatest scientists and the best established theories when newton was the outstanding name in physics eccentric works in that science were violently anti newton today with einstein the father symbol of authority a crank theory of physics is likely to attack einstein in the name of newton NUMBER he often has a tendency to write in a complex jargon in many cases making use of terms and phrases he himself has coined terry w colvin sierra vista arizona usa forteanNUMBER URL alternate forteanNUMBER URL home page URL sites fortean times mystic s haven tlcb u s message text formatting usmtf program member thailand laos cambodia brotherhood tlcb mailing list tlcb web site URL vietnam veterans allies cia nsa and steenkeen contractors are welcome to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteana unsubscribe URL your use of yahoo groups is subject to URL

stare at live query long enough and you feel you are watching the collective consciousness of the world stream by each line represents a thought from someone somewhere with an internet connection google collects these queries _ NUMBER million a day from more than NUMBER countries _ in its databases updating and storing the computer logs millisecond by millisecond google is taking snapshots of its users minds and aggregating them so what is the world thinking about sex for one thing you can learn to say sex in a lot of different languages by looking at the logs said craig silverstein director of technology at google to keep live query g rated google filters out sex related searches though less successfully with foreign languages despite its geographic and ethnic diversity the world is spending much of its time thinking about the same things the same topic areas bubble to the top celebrities current events products and computer downloads it s amazing how similar people are all over the world based on what they are searching for said greg rae one of three members of google s logs team which is responsible for building storing and protecting the data record google s following _ it is the most widely used search engine _ has given mr rae a worldview from his cubicle since october NUMBER he has been able to reel off anthrax in several languages including milzbrand in german and carbonchio in italian he says he can also tell which countries took their recent elections seriously brazil and germany because of the frenzy of searches he notes that the globalisation of consumer culture means that the most popular brands are far flung in origin nokia sony bmw ferrari ikea and microsoft judging from google s data some sports events stir interest almost everywhere the tour de france wimbledon the melbourne cup horse race and the world series were among the top NUMBER sports related searches last year it also becomes obvious just how familiar american movies music and celebrities are to searchers across the globe two years ago a google engineer named lucas pereira noticed that searches for britney spears had declined indicating what he thought must be a decline in her popularity from that observation grew google zeitgeist a listing of the top gaining and declining queries of each week and month glancing over google zeitgeist is like taking a trivia test in cultural literacy ulrika jonsson the swedish born british television host and girlfriend of england football coach sven goran eriksson made the list recently so did irish travellers a nomadic ethnic group one of whose members was videotaped beating her young daughter in indiana and fentanyl the narcotic gas used in the moscow raid to rescue hostages taken by chechen rebels in late october the long lasting volume of searches involving her name has made britney spears something of a benchmark for the logs team it has helped them understand how news can cause spikes in searches as it did when she broke up with justin timberlake google can feel the reverberations of such events and others of a more serious nature immediately on feb NUMBER NUMBER for example an earthquake began near seattle at NUMBER NUMBER am local time within two minutes earthquake related searches jumped to NUMBER a minute from almost none with a concentration in the us pacific northwest on sept NUMBER searches for the world trade center pentagon and cnn shot up immediately after the attacks over the next few days nostradamus became the top search query fuelled by a rumour that nostradamus had predicted the trade center s destruction but the most trivial events may also register on google s sensitive cultural seismic meter the logs team came to work one morning to find that carol brady maiden name had surged to the top of the charts curious they mapped the searches by time of day and found that they were neatly grouped in five spikes each one starting at NUMBER minutes after the hour as the logs were passed through the office employees were perplexed why would there be a surge in interest in a character from the NUMBERs sitcom the brady bunch but the data could only reflect patterns not explain them that is a paradox of a google log it does not capture social phenomena per se but merely the shadows they cast across the internet the most interesting part is why said amit patel who has been a member of the logs team you can t interpret it unless you know what else is going on in the world so what had gone on on april NUMBER NUMBER that night the million dollar question on the game show who wants to be a millionaire had been what was carol brady s maiden name seconds after the show s host posed the question thousands flocked to google to search for the answer tyler producing four spikes as the show was broadcast successively in each us time zone the precision of the carol brady data was eye opening for some it was like trying an electron microscope for the first time said sergey brin who as a graduate student in computer science at stanford helped found google in NUMBER and is now its president for technology it was like a moment by moment barometer predictably google s query data respond to television movies and radio but the mass media also feed off the demands of their audiences one of google s strengths is its predictive power flagging trends before they hit the radar of other media as such it could be of tremendous value to entertainment companies or retailers google is quiet about what if any plans it has for commercialising its vast store of query information there is tremendous opportunity with this data mr silverstein said the challenge is defining what we want to do google currently does not allow outsiders to gain access to raw data because of privacy concerns searches are logged by time of day originating ip address information that can be used to link searches to a specific computer and the sites on which the user clicked people tell things to search engines that they would never talk about publicly _ viagra pregnancy scares fraud facelifts what is interesting in the aggregate can be seem an invasion of privacy if narrowed to an individual in aggregate form google s data can make a stunning presentation next to mr rae s cubicle is the geodisplay a NUMBER inch screen that gives a three dimensional geographical representation of where google is being used around the globe the searches are represented by coloured dots shooting into the atmosphere the colours _ red yellow orange _ convey the impression of a globe whose major cities are on fire the tallest flames are in new york tokyo and the san francisco bay area each country has a distinctive usage pattern spain france and italy have a midday lull in google searches presumably reflecting leisurely lunches and relaxation in japan the peak usage is after midnight when phone rates for dial up modems drop google s worldwide scope means

ham,one of the main strands of this modernisation is to have all stations on a retained basis at night basically this means that the fire station will be unmanned and in the event of a fire the fire fighters will be summonsed by pagers the same way that they currently are in a lot of rural regions the main reason for this is that fewer fires occur at night however the majority of fatalities in fires do occur at night and the recent deaths during the fire fighters strike all occurred at night over half of these happened in areas currently covered by retained crews who aren t on strike and would appear to give a grim foreshadowing of what may be to come currently one of the conditions for being in a retained crew is that you must live work within one mile of the station how they will apply this to whole time fire fighters is still unclear a good friend of mine is a station officer in hampshire and currently lives NUMBER miles from his station so how he ll respond to fire calls at night is a mystery and i can t see many fire fighters living within a mile of some of the inner london stations dave to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteana unsubscribe URL your use of yahoo groups is subject to URL

these guides on your computer s hard disk as other people will be ordering these guides from you paying you for them and you will need to email the guides to the new buyers step NUMBER from the list of names above delete the name and address of the person shown under guide NUMBER and replace that slot with the name and address of the person from guide NUMBER s slot be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown check the address again step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with the name and address from guide NUMBER s slot step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with the name and address from guide NUMBER s slot step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with the name and address from guide NUMBER s slot step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with your own name and address this step is how your own name and address is entered into the list of names to receive orders for the guides eventually your own name will go down the list of names until you have reached guide NUMBER and then be dropped from the list the key point is that the number of people ordering guides from you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes step NUMBER once you have completed this new list send out this new email which shows your name under guide NUMBER to as many email addresses as possible as many as NUMBER NUMBER emails or even more the greater the number of mailings you make potentially the greater the number of people who will order the guide NUMBER from you these people will then make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email showing your name under guide NUMBER and so on this is all you need to do if you wish to read the rest of this email message then do so if not just do the NUMBER steps shown above remember the key point is to send out as many emails as possible in step NUMBER and to encourage and help those who purchase the guides from you to send out emails of their own do not change anything other than what is instructed because if you do it will not work for you your immediate reaction might be why not replace all the names on the list with the names of your spouse kids relatives and friends that might seem to you like a clever move because new buyers will be sending their money to these people but that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit what will benefit you most is having people who will send out emails seek new buyers and provide assistance to new buyers if the people you slip into that list aren t going to be sending new emails you re only hurting yourself by effectively closing down the program with your name on top of the list of the names that you have inserted there wouldn t be new buyers coming in so your sly maneuver will gain you exactly zero furthermore if you have done the work and your name has worked its way to further down the list by then you deserve the rewards and earnings from that effort and it would be unethical for anyone to remove your name for whatever reason don t do it to others remember honesty reaps the reward you may have a concern that after sending the total NUMBER to the five people on the list that one of the people will just take your money and not send you the guide well rest assured as we said above it s to our benefit to have you as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find new buyers so don t think the people on the list will try to cheat you or to stiff you for NUMBER NUMBER the people on the list would rather have you working hard because your effort will benefit them as well as you later on when other buyers send you the order to buy the guides fulfill your end of the deal by sending the ordered guide to the buyer don t cheat provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit end of summary rest of message with easy to use email tools and opt in email success in this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary people who may not have done any internet marketing before and the earnings potential is staggering read this email to the end follow what it says and you will not worry whether a recession is coming or not or whether or not you can afford to buy that new car or home that you have been looking for yes i know what you are thinking i never responded to one of these before either one day though something made me feel you use NUMBER going to a movie for NUMBER hours with your spouse friend or child plus a simple meat at a restaurant why the heck not no

NUMBER by sending bulk email legally let s say that you start small to see how it goes and that you and those involved send out only NUMBER NUMBER emails each let s also assume that the mailing receives only a NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER of NUMBER response the response could be much better but let s just say it is only NUMBER NUMBER also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of

each for a total of NUMBER NUMBER emails sent out the NUMBER NUMBER response is NUMBER orders for guide NUMBER those NUMBER people send out NUMBER NUMBER emails each for a total of NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER emails the NUMBER NUMBER response to that is NUMBER NUMBER orders for guide NUMBER or NUMBER NUMBER at NUMBER per guide this may seem a small amount to you but remember we used a very low response rate with a small number of emails being sent out see what happens if you can get the response rate up just slightly if response rate is NUMBER NUMBER income from guides NUMBER NUMBER is NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER as above if response rate is NUMBER NUMBER income from guides NUMBER NUMBER is NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER if response rate is NUMBER NUMBER income from guides NUMBER NUMBER is NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one NUMBERth of those people mailed NUMBER NUMBER emails each or more from the example above you can see the power of leveraging that is how much greater is the amount of money from a small increase in the response rate there are over NUMBER million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming online every day method NUMBER placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are many free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will get a response we strongly suggest you start with method NUMBER and add method NUMBER as you go along for every NUMBER you receive all you must do is email the guide the buyer ordered always provide same day service the people you buy these guides from will assist and advise you how to get the large number of email addresses that you need to send the new email containing your name and address in return when others buy the guides from you you also should help those buyers to resell the guides to their email addresses this will benefit you because your name would be further down the list and their new buyers will buy from you this is no different than customer service in the retail or the bricks and mortars business available guides the reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong it is simply about time time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you order each guide by its number name only always send a single NUMBER bill u s currency for each guide checks not accepted make sure the cash is hidden by wrapping it in at least NUMBER sheets of paper on one of those sheets of paper write the number the name of the guide you are ordering your email address and your name and postal address be sure to address the envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to mail the envelope place your order for these guides now from the name and address list shown at the beginning of this email ________________________________________________ your success guidelines if you do not receive at least NUMBER orders for guide NUMBER within NUMBER weeks continue sending emails until you do two to three weeks after you receive NUMBER orders you should receive NUMBER orders or more for guide NUMBER if not continue advertising or sending emails until you do once you have received NUMBER or more orders for guide NUMBER you can see the program is working and cash should continue coming in this is important to remember continue to assist new buyers with advice and instruction on how to send out more emails you can keep track of progress by noting which guides people are ordering from you if you want to generate more income send another batch of emails and start the whole process again there is no limit to the income you can generate a note from the originator of this program you have just received information that can give you financial freedom to really change your life but i don t wish to kid you this requires a bit of effort you

instructions parents of NUMBER year old find NUMBER NUMBER cash hidden in his closet does this headline look familiar of course it does you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program usa and reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods new zealand his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her NUMBER year old sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labelled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the NUMBER year old woman there was over NUMBER NUMBER dollars in that bag that s more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via e mail a type of report to e mail addresses that he obtained off the internet everyday after school for the past NUMBER months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom i just got the e mail one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out says the clever NUMBER year old the e mail letter listed NUMBER addresses and contained instructions to send one NUMBER dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within NUMBER weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the NUMBER address list i get junk e mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the e mail the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing NUMBER bills about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had NUMBER magazine and about NUMBER envelops stuffed in it there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter i thought i was in trouble or something laughs he goes on i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the e mail the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the NUMBER bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didn t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for URL time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the so called chain letter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at URL fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title NUMBER section NUMBER and NUMBER or title NUMBER section NUMBER in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume NUMBER sections NUMBER and NUMBER which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received every five dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read please send me report number

NUMBER see below as seen on national tv this is the media report parents of NUMBER year old find NUMBER NUMBER cash hidden in his closet does this headline look familiar of course it does you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program usa and reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods new zealand his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her NUMBER year old sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labeled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the NUMBER year old woman there was over NUMBER NUMBER dollars in that bag that s more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via e mail a type of report to e mail addresses that he obtained off the internet everyday after school for the past NUMBER months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom i just got the e mail one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out says the clever NUMBER year old the e mail letter listed NUMBER addresses and contained instructions to send one NUMBER dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within NUMBER weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the NUMBER address list i get junk e mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the e mail the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing NUMBER bills about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had NUMBER magazine and about NUMBER envelops stuffed in it there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter i thought i was in trouble or something laughs he goes on i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the e mail the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the NUMBER bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didn t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the so called chain letter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at all in fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title NUMBER section NUMBER and NUMBER or title NUMBER section NUMBER in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume NUMBER sections NUMBER and NUMBER which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received every five dollar bill that

spam, welcome to ghetto america yes you heard me i said ghetto america what is ghetto america i m glad you asked before i go on please be warned this explanation may not sit well with many of you however it is no less true ghetto america is a society of individuals comprised primarily of african americans who represent the impoverished and often unpolished side of black america confused i shall explain further have you ever passed by a typical ghetto community namely the projects and noticed an unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular neighborhood and wondered how could that be or maybe you have been to a shopping mall and noticed an unusual amount of young teen looking black women carrying infants or pushing baby carriages and often with a toddler in tow perhaps you also noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying them if you paid close attention you might have also noticed the absence of the all important wedding band missing from their respective ring fingers and of course we have all heard stories of young black men carrying guns and knives allegedly mugging robbing and carjacking people of all sorts did you know that many young african american women refuse to date african american males if they do not own or possess an automobile in fact many young black women prefer only to date individuals who represent the subversive side of society commonly known as thugs or street hustlers also did you know that many young african american males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while living in government housing better known as the projects rather than move away purchase new homes save or even make investments attention this is not another boyz in the hood story these newly distinguished black generation xers are suffering through utter chaos baby makers loser choosers welfare abusers images of my america is a collection of observations and commentary as told through the eyes of a young african american male who experienced and perpetuated many of the truths that many in black america and the world in general would have you believe do not exist it is a riveting expose that sheds light on the oppressive and often discriminatory nature of mainstream american society a society that has nurtured the rampant disregards for self respect and enlightenment that many young african american men and women currently suffer from the writer supports his arguments with direct references to the overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to raise children with many being teens themselves and the foolish criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates oftentimes being based on nothing more than the young black male s tough or cool neighborhood reputation the author also identifies the self destructive and often criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily basis like refusing to pursue higher education carrying guns robbing stealing selling drugs driving fancy cars and wearing expensive jewelry the negative and self debasing behavior committed by both males and females is due in large part to a lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless homes these poor choices and behavioral disorders coupled with the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in the form of welfare abuse and over crowded prison populations are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty and lack of direction that currently exists in young black america today to learn more about this dynamic self contained society visit URL and reserve your copy today to request an excerpt please email books URL buy this soon to be best seller now URL

spam, foreword after thirty three years of being a black man living in ghetto america an environment notorious for danger crime and poverty i have made startling discoveries involving young african american men and women who comprise what i have come to define as the black generation x i have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young african americans from the general definition of generation x aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed baby boomers it s important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young african american culture i have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth childhood and young adult life taken from a web site entitled generation x created and maintained by the colorado college the definition is as follows we are a group of people born between NUMBER and NUMBER we are individuals who live for the here and now like to experiment and who require immediate results we are typically selfish and cynical and depend a lot on our parents we question authority and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations it s that simple it seems we have come to be called xer s simply because we represent something negative to our elders we may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings of course they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility or actually their fault our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse we are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school it appears we have little hope for the future no jobs no homes and basically no money are almost expected of us these bleak prospects along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever do not provide much hope some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood as our saviors we will soon discover who is right and who is wrong this definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that generation x is comprised of one core group of american citizens it over generalizes the similarities it expresses and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years when in fact these similarities speak primarily to only white issues and concerns for instance they say we depend a lot on our parents but in ghetto america we could only depend on one our mothers they also say we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations and we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever in ghetto america no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now and is all we have time for i have known for many years that the differences that separate generation xer s black and white occupants would eventually be identified i never knew i would be the one doing it extracting the black from generation x and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency without doing so the social ills that plague ghetto america would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective american identity there are many hidden truths that exist in black america today white america charges that we spend our time collecting welfare refusing to vote reading elementary styled books watching music videos day dreaming of becoming rappers basketball players selling drugs and making babies much of this is supported in marlon riggs s documentary entitled ethnic notions when african americans are mentioned whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book a reality that i confirmed while watching roger me another documentary written and directed by michael moore sadly many of us have begun to validate this skewed image while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for b e t black entertainment television many of us fail to realize that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex posed truth may reveal should be taken as an opportunity to improve empower enlighten and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior regarding black women i have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities i began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole that black men owed them something and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives be it emotional physical or economical normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended in most cases it has not been it s funny though looking back i am surprised i never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to or the various schools of thought they possessed many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the african american male some fair and some unfair much of what the public believes and understands about the black female s social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is what originally sparked my attention was an observation i stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction i noticed virtually all of the books i read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent african american perspective these stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all african americans thrive on a middle to upper class professional level they relay stories of relationship problems with huxtable like bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love as i read these stories i couldn t help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or working class african americans although there are those in the black community that can identify with the huxtable like dynamic unfortunately they are few and far between the majority of stories i have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued black america the black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our dirty laundry the fact is truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind i recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal as our discussion intensified i reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed and oftentimes not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself the purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self destructive thinking and self imprisoning behavior that black male and female generation x have been subscribing to while discussing this with my friend she suggested i simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what i m attempting to convey acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood i suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative to grab a dictionary don t feel bad there were several times i had to as well regarding black men an overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool buying sports wear driving expensive cars wearing gold or platinum jewelry and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions i have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of african american culture because i have lived it i have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level it is a world of ignorance selfishness pre occupation and idiocy in my world there are people who applaud a lack of education who brag about having served time in u s penitentiaries the types of guns they carry dope peddling and chasing women they champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit in this world wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they ve got a million it s a world where children dress in over priced sports wear mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye thinking such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one s self worth and the possible corruption this thinking breeds seems to not be an important concern for black mothers it may come as a shock to know that most african americans feel that those who don t have the same if not better material possessions are lesser beings referring to them as being corny lame or broke even our male rapper entertainers promote backward priorities nothing else matters as long as you look good the big tymers a popular rap duo have a song called i m still fly shown in heavy rotation on b e t and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country fly is ghetto vernacular for well dressed also used to describe a female s beauty its signature verse asserts i got gator boots with a pimped out gucci suit can t pay my rent cause all my money s spent but that s o k cause i m still fly worse yet in the song grinding the popular duo eclipse glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video the term grinding is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs the fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on b e t is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil some of the key lyrics to this song are grinding you know what i keep in the lining the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs and patty cake patty cake i m the bakers man i bake them cakes as fast as i can and you can tell cause of how my bread stack up and i disguise it as rap so the feds backup in this verse the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack when created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake hence the term cake or sometimes pie unfortunately for the rap genre this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law the negative references i ve identified have become an integral part of the urban african american existence this mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable this ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has there is an overwhelming part of the african american community that is aware of this crippling mentality there are also many that are unaware and unfortunately more that do not even care those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily whether because of habit or misguided values this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance it should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us we must save ourselves i am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now and are thinking what right do i have to express the opinions i have thus far as well as those i have al luded too i have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content there is far too much negativity thriving within our culture there must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth whether good or bad i am aware that not all of us have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community and i have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life any similarities and generalizations i illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified additionally throughout this book i will refer to african americans in four different ways the first being african americans denoting our status as citizens in the united states secondly as black a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country third as niggas a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with nigger the term nigga has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship hence the term my nigga as well as a blanket reference when speaking to of or about other black males in a non personal manner i felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences i will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place and fourth as ghetto this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the less polished members of our community it is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such my commentary is based on real life situations both good and bad and how one african american man was affected by them to that end i feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals i have encountered despite the negativity they have displayed i only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to in many ways has caused them to become their own worst enemy in the case of the black female s negative and limited perspective toward black men the world and subconsciously themselves i submit that this mentality is perhaps single handedly responsible for the lack of success happiness and quality of life that is at the center of every african american woman s fantasy quest it is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men has been deliberately created by white america for example much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day many past issues have taken on new identities and have re emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men the resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate america without realizing and ackno wledging that this absence is by design there are other core issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation such as color barriers light skin versus dark skin good hair versus bad hair loyalty devotion and economic status believe it or not there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn t sell drugs or was not thugged out a term for being rough or hoodlum like the reasoning behind it being that the thug and drug dealer lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence these issues among others relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society sadly that confused mentality is responsible for much of the neglect the african american ghetto community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren who have locked it away in the basement and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that ghetto america does not exist furthermore the lack of acknowledgement of which i speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the african american community their plight is a well known reality but in many cases much of ghetto america falls under that same umbrella be advised this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into black america rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young african americans including myself have come to perpetuate moreover that backward thinking is the main cause of our inability to strive for a common goal an outcome that must be met and can only be met with godly faith positive strategy cooperation love loyalty self and

the dirty little secret of the internet you ve probably heard stories about people making whopping huge money online but you thought they were the big corporate execs famous programmers or boy geniuses well grasshopper think again it s people like you and me that are making the real money yep people like you and me ever since the dot com bubble burst in NUMBER small time entrepreneurs are getting richer while the fortune NUMBER companies look for bankruptcy lawyers today small business owners and ordinary folks like you and me can use the web to achieve complete financial freedom with no investment and very little work how by learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created it s called bulk email if you ve ever recieved an email advertisement then you know what bulk email is i bet you can t click on delete fast enough for most of those ads right you might not want their product but remember that thousands of other folks probably do bulk email is a percentage game every bulker who contacts you makes a six figure income on the internet i guarantee it now let s go back to math NUMBER and review some numbers if you sell on ebay you pay anywhere from a few dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one auction how many people see your ad maybe a couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand over a period of days using bulk email you can send your ad to more than a million people a day at virtually no cost whether your send NUMBER NUMBER emails or NUMBER million emails the price is the same zero stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when hardly anyone sees your ad imagine that you have a decent product with a profit margin of NUMBER NUMBER on each sale if you send an email ad to NUMBER NUMBER people and only one person in a thousand actually places an order then you just generated NUMBER orders and made NUMBER NUMBER in a few hours of work it s that simple all you have to do is convince one person out of a thousand to buy your stuff and you re filthy rich the best thing is that anyone can do it doesn t matter if you re a nineteen year old college student using a dorm room computer or a fifty year old executive working from an office building in new york city anyone and i repeat anyone can start bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs all it takes is a few days of study plenty of ambition and some basic familiarity with the internet i quit college when i was NUMBER to capitalize on the dot com mania and i ve never looked back i started with no money no product to sell and only the most rudimentary computer skills i saw an opportunity and i seized it a few years later i bought my own home with cash you don t need any money you don t need a product you don t need to be a computer nerd and no experience

For the Baseline Development, a neural network approach was used.
filter.py and NN_filter.py can be ignored.

TO RUN THE PROJECT:
Run main.py in the NN_filter folder
this file calls model.py and utils.py and uses the data set in the data folder

Note: data_analysis.py was used to make a graph and is not related to the filter.
